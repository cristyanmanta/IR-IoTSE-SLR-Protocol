Due to IoT, life is transformed into smart life, such as smart buildings, smart vehicles, smart agriculture, smart businesses, etc., by connecting a certain number of things to the internet. Many people are now working on ways to locate indoor things to interact and exchange data between smart things and web services and apps, which is called “WoT,” or “Web of Things.” To interact and exchange the data, researchers need a search engine on WoT. However, locating indoor things in the Web of Things (WoT) remains a challenge due to the lack of a unified indexing system. In this research, we propose a novel approach to index indoor things in the WoT by leveraging machine learning and web technologies. Our approach includes a data preprocessing step, where we extract relevant features from the sensor data, followed by a clustering algorithm to group similar devices. We then use a semantic model to assign meaning to the clusters and develop a search engine to enable efficient searching of indoor things. Our proposed approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of locating indoor things in the WoT, paving the way for new applications in smart homes, healthcare, and industrial automation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3272691","Deanship of Scientific Research at Majmaah University(grant numbers:R-2023-376); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10114802","Naïve Bayes;cluster;crawling;indexing;indoor things;things indexer;symbolic data","Indexing;Internet of Things;Search engines;Fingerprint recognition;Distributed databases;Calibration;Wireless fidelity","","1","","71","CCBYNCND","3 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some of the earlier research introduced models to facilitate streaming data compression and the subsequent indexing. However, as IoT data come from multiple sensors and differ in terms of variety and velocity, there is still an urgent need to build an efficient indexing mechanism so that we can optimise responses to users’ queries. In this research, we identify a variety of queries from different motivating scenarios and develop a framework to optimise the way to access and retrieve IoT streaming data to respond to the users’ queries. To this end, (i) a streaming data scenario is analysed, and (ii) an optimisation framework with indexing schemes from multiple sources are introduced, and (iii) some common and illustrative queries are presented to explain optimisation.

In conventional CR networks, secondary users (SUs) sense the whole block of spectrum to find idle channels, which is an energy-consuming, delay-inducing, and processing-intensive task. With the large scale of resource-constrained heterogeneous devices in CR- $m$ IoT, the sensing process becomes a major hurdle for CR- $m$ IoT devices to achieve efficient utilization of the limited device and network resources. Thus, a novel multiparameter-based flexible scheme is proposed for idle channel prediction and channel ranking, which considers priorities as well as heterogeneity of users. The scheme uses a probabilistic approach and employs multiple parameters simultaneously to evaluate the suitability of a channel before selecting it for transmission. In addition, valid channel obsolescence, a major problem inherent with channel prediction and ranking, is countered by the proposed scheme. The scheme is evaluated under the impact of variable primary and SUs’ arrivals and under multiple channel failures rates and variable sensing and frame time duration. The proposed scheme is also compared with its own modified version that disregards channel failures, and with the random channel selection approach followed by IEEE 802.22. The overall evaluation is conducted under realistic spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that for different parameter values, the proposed scheme improves the collision probability by 11%–55%, reduces sensing time and energy by 60% and 65%, respectively, and enhances throughput by 4%–70%, and spectrum utilization efficiency by 11%–40%.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3084677","National Research Foundation of Korea-Grant funded by the Korean Government (Ministry of Science and ICT)(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A2B5B02002478); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444285","Channel prediction;channel ranking;cognitive radio network (CRN);flexibility;massive Internet of Things (mIoT);resource allocation","Sensors;Quality of service;Throughput;Internet of Things;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Interference;Signal to noise ratio","","6","","42","IEEE","28 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So it is an indispensable step to check whether the required perception services with specified arguments have been available for the constructing IoT through discovery method to reduce the redundancy of service deployment. However, it is a challenging problem to design efficient (i.e., achieving high accuracy and low response delay with low overhead), highly robust, and trustworthy mechanisms for discovering perception services on resource-constrained IoT devices. To solve this problem, we proposed a distributed service discovery method, named VSA-SD, based on the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). This method employs hyperdimensional vectors to describe services in a distributed manner, and measures the degree of service matching by calculating the Hamming distance, thereby achieving service discovery. We implemented VSA-SD in NBUFlow, which is an IoT task construction and offloading test platform, and evaluated its performance through comprehensive experiments.

A physical object is the fundamental building block of the IoT, known as a Smart Device, that can monitor the environment. These devices can communicate with each other and have data processing abilities. When deployed, smart devices collect real-time data and publish the gathered data on the Web. The functionality of smart devices can be abstracted as a service and an IoT application can be built by combining the smart devices with these services that help to address challenges of day-to-day activities. The IoT comprises billions of these intelligent communicating devices that generate enormous amount of data, and hence performing analysis on this data is a significant task. Using search techniques, the size and extent of data can be reduced and limited, so that an application can choose just the most important and valuable data items as per its necessities. It is, however, a tedious task to effectively seek and select a proper device and/or its data among a large number of available devices for a specific application. Search techniques are fundamental to IoT and poses various challenges like a large number of devices, dynamic availability, restrictions on resource utilization, real time data in various types and formats, past and historical monitoring. In the recent past, various methods and techniques have been developed by the research community to address these issues.

Invariably, the IoT-SE envisions distributed query retrieval to handle massive volumes of devices and data. Incorporating the massively heterogeneous protocols and properties of devices deployed, the search of such a system for timely and pertinent data is massively challenging, to provide useful knowledge and service for IoT systems.

The IoT network is known for its highly dynamic topology and frequently changing characteristics (e.g., the devices’ status, such as battery capacity and computational power); traditional methods fail to learn and understand the evolving behavior of the network to enable real-time and context-aware service discovery in such diverse and large-scale topologies of IoT networks. The Social IoT (SIoT) concept, which defines the relationships among the connected objects, can be exploited to extract established relationships between devices and enable trustworthy and context-aware services. In fact, SIoT expresses the possible connections that devices can establish in the network and reflect compatibility, trustworthiness, and so on. In this paper, we investigate the service discovery process in SIoT networks by proposing a low-complexity context-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to enable rapid and dynamic service discovery. Unlike the conventional graph-based techniques, the proposed approach simultaneously embeds the devices’ features and their SIoT relations. Our simulations on a real-world IoT dataset show that the proposed GNN-based approach can provide more concise clusters compared to traditional techniques, namely the Louvain and Leiden algorithms.

In this article, we have considered an order-driven scenario of a smart factory, where wearable devices provide various services and communicate with the service providers. The discovery process generates numerous smart factory services. The selection of an appropriate (or a set of) service(s) remains a challenge while preserving the service data privacy. It is required to involve an anonymous communication mechanism to design a privacy-preserved ranking model. The prevalent techniques for the prioritization of semantically equivalent sensor-provided services rely on quality-of-service (QoS) information. However, the QoS information is not always readily available at the node level. Moreover, the existing topological information-based (i.e., node importance and energy) solutions do not consider imperative features, such as a degree. The objective of this study is to design a privacy-preserved ranking model based on the onion routing technique and features along with the stochastic shortest route. Onion routing enables anonymous communication and prevents unauthorized entities from accessing ranking results. The weighted valuation is then derived to compute the cost of the homogeneous and dynamic sensor-provided services. Finally, the ranking is computed based on each service cost. The proposed model is extensively evaluated in two different network configurations of varying sizes. The evaluation results show that the proposed method performs 10% better in terms of ranking quality and 32% in terms of energy efficiency across different network configurations, as compared with the existing cost-based method while offering a desired level of privacy.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2020.2981563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9042308","Internet-of-things (IoT);privacy-preserved ranking;sensing-as-a-service (S2aaS);service valuation;wireless sensor network","Sensors;Privacy;Quality of service;Production facilities;Smart manufacturing","","1","","26","IEEE","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the endurance issue as a “nightmare” always haunts NVRAM system developers. Worse still, NVRAM’s lifespan will wear out soon in embedded applications because their data management systems usually utilize an indexing scheme to maintain small data. Plus, a node structure within the indexing scheme will be frequently updated because of data creation and deletion. Therefore, many previous works rethink B+-tree indexing scheme on an NVRAM-based system. The most previous studies focused on reducing the amount of write traffic to memory. Unfortunately, they are failed to extend the NVRAM lifespan because their solution cannot evenly distribute the amount of write traffic to each memory cell. Additionally, prior solutions have not considered that all nodes within B+-tree indexing structure have different update frequencies. Based on such the observation, this work proposes a wear-leveling-aware B+-tree design, namely, waB+-tree, to consider the update frequency of each node within the B+-tree structure, so as to evenly scatter the amount of write traffic to the NVRAM cells. According to our experiments, the proposed waB+-tree shows the encouraging results of endurance improvement.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2021.3049677","Academia Sinica(grant numbers:AS-CDA-107-M05); Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:109-2218-E-002-019,107-2923-E-001-001-MY3,107-2218-E-008-023-MY3,108-2221-E-001-001-MY3,108-2221-E-008-099-MY3,108-2221-E-001-004-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314895","B⁺-tree structure;endurance;indexing scheme;nonvolatile random-access memory (NVRAM)-based system","Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Indexing;Memory management;Performance evaluation;Power demand;DH-HEMTs","","3","","25","IEEE","6 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To minimize the cost of querying XML data, researchers have proposed many indexing techniques. Nearly all the techniques, partition the XML data into a number of data-streams. To evaluate a query, existing twig pattern matching algorithms process a subset of the data-streams simultaneously. Processing many data-streams simultaneously results in some or all of the following four problems, namely, the accessing of many data nodes which don’t appear in the final solution of a given query, the generation of duplicate results, the generation of huge number of intermediate results, and the cost of merging the generated intermediate results. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing twig pattern matching algorithms suffer from some or all of the above mentioned problems. This paper proposes a new twig pattern matching algorithm called MatchQTP which processes one data-stream at a time and avoids all the above mentioned four problems. It also proposes a new indexing technique called RLP-Index and a new XML node labeling scheme called RLP-Scheme, both of which are used by MatchQTP. Unlike the existing indexing techniques, RLP-Index stores a subset of the data nodes. The rest of the data nodes can be generated efficiently. This minimizes storage space utilization and query processing time and makes RLP-Index the first of its kind. Many experiments were conducted to study the performance of MatchQTP. The results show that MatchQTP is very efficient and highly scalable. It was also compared with four algorithms, three of which are used frequently in the literature to compare the performance of new algorithms and the fourth algorithm is the state-of-the-art algorithm.

To reveal the potential of IoT, rich knowledge has to be extracted, indexed, and shared securely in real time. Recent comprehensive researches on IoT spot the light on main correlative challenges, such as security, scalability, heterogeneity, and big data. Due to the heterogeneity of IoT applications that produce a large volume of a variety of data streams in real time, mining, securing, and analyzing IoT data become tedious and challenging tasks. Indexing sensory data is one of data mining techniques, which ease information retrieval. But ordinary indexing methods are not fit with such massive and dynamic data; where indexes become out-of-date once they are built. Clustering, data reduction, and summarization present promising solutions for enabling low-power security and balanced indexing. This article presents a novel method for dynamic data reduction and summarization using dynamic time warping (DTW), which also presents a balanced architecture for enabling balanced indexing based on similarity data fusion. Data reduction-based prediction models enable real-time search and secure discovery for Smart Things (SThs). The results of the proposed model were proved using real examples and data sets. Using the Szeged-weather data set similar SThs data is reduced by 95%. Thus, indexes sizes could be reduced, and using smart scheduling, crawling cycle length could be expanded.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3035248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9246534","Balanced indexing;crowd sensing;data management and analytics;efficient communications;industrial Internet of Things (IoT);similarity search;time series;trajectory clustering data sets","Internet of Things;Indexing;Real-time systems;Security;Data integration;Big Data;Cloud computing","","12","","99","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The communication technologies allow one IoT device to discover and communicate with another in order to exchange services, in a similar way to what humans do in their social networks. Knowing the reputation of another device is important to consider whether it is trustworthy before establishing a new connection and thus, avoid possible unexpected behaviors as a consequence. Trustworthiness, as a property of a device, can be affected by different factors including its geographical location. Hence, this research work proposes an architecture to manage reputation values of end devices in an IoT system based on the area where they are located. A cloud–fog–edge architecture is proposed, where the fog layer uses the Blockchain technology to keep the reputation management system consistent and fault tolerant across different nodes. The location-based part of the system was done by storing geographical areas in smart contracts (coined as geospatial smart contracts) and making the reputation values subject to different regions depending on the geographical location of the device. To reduce the complexity of the spatial computation, the geographical data are geocoded by either one of two different spatial indexing techniques. This work also introduced two different structures for storing geocoded areas based on either cell list or tree structure. Finally, three experiments to test the proposed architecture are presented, to deploy the architecture in IoT devices, and to compare the two geocoding techniques in smart contracts.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3147478","TRUST4IoE Project of the Programa Estatal de Proyectos de I+D de Generación de Conocimiento of the Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2019-104065GA-I00); Postdoctoral Juan de la Cierva Fellowship Programme of the Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation(grant numbers:IJC2018-035017-I); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9697067","Blockchain;Internet of Things (IoT);location-based trust;spatial indexing","Computer architecture;Blockchains;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Smart contracts;Indexing;Geospatial analysis","","17","","26","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel approach for indexing distributed IoT sources and paves the way to design a data discovery service to search and gain access to their data. The proposed method creates concise references to IoT sources by using Gaussian mixture models. Furthermore, a summary update mechanism is introduced to tackle the change of sources availability and mitigate the overhead of updating the indices frequently.

With the increasing development of IoT devices, the corresponding security issues are becoming more and more challenging. Such a severe security situation raises the following questions that need urgent attention: What are the primary security threats that IoT devices face currently? How do vendors and users deal with these threats? In this article, we aim to answer these critical questions through a large-scale systematic study. Specifically, we perform a ten-month-long empirical study on the vulnerability of 1,362,906 IoT devices varying from six types. The results show sufficient evidence that N-days vulnerability is seriously endangering the IoT devices: 385,060 (28.25 percent) devices suffer from at least one N-days vulnerability. Moreover, 2669 of these vulnerable devices may have been compromised by botnets. We further reveal the massive differences among five popular IoT search engines: Shodan [1], Censys [2], [3], Zoomeye [4], Fofa [5], and NTI [6]. To study whether vendors and users adopt defenses against the threats, we measure the security of MQTT [7] servers, and identify that 12740 (88 percent) MQTT servers have no password protection. Our analysis can serve as an important guideline for investigating the security of IoT devices, as well as advancing the development of a more secure environment for IoT systems.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.3037908","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0804102); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772466,U1936215,U1836202); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:LR19F020003); Zhejiang Provincial Key R&D Program(grant numbers:2019C01055); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Army Research Laboratory; Ministry of Defence(grant numbers:W911NF-16-3-0001); State Key Laboratory of Information Security(grant numbers:2020-MS-12); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LQ21F020010); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772507,61972448,61872181); Zhejiang University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259111","IoT search engine;vulnerable device assessment","Security;Search engines;Internet of Things;Internet;Servers;Engines;Password","","25","","61","IEEE","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to get access to specific data, which is crucial to enable a myriad of new intelligent applications, efficient information retrieval becomes an imminent need for IoT. However, sensor information in the physical world can be heterogeneous, high dimensional, and voluminous due to the complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we first investigate several IoT search scenarios and propose a uniform representation model for sensor information recordings. Four query models are designed to represent all possible information query styles. With these models, we develop information retrieval architecture for IoT. In essence, an indexing mechanism called efficiency maximization and cost minimization is proposed to solve the property selection problem in the process of index construction and update.

Many search engines have been designed in the last two decades, which aim to collect the necessary information from services based on requested scans. Shodan and Censys are the most famous of these engines. In current search engines, users are not given the capability to engineer their searches by managing detailed and effective variables. This includes making adjustable variables related to scanning processes to intelligently extract the information requested by the user. Additionally, there is no facility to track errors that occur at different stages of scanning and information extraction, which is essential for identifying bottlenecks and adopting methods to address them. Moreover, these systems do not provide real-time identification services for controlling and managing cyber incidents according to specific ports and protocols requested by the user. They also fail to issue specific warnings that align with the policies of researchers and industrial owners. Furthermore, users are unable to define advanced queries to accurately extract information from existing big data using a variety of logical operators. These limitations underscore the need for more sophisticated and customizable search engine capabilities. The new strengths of the proposed engine, which is called I-Recon, are: 1) The ability to trace the reasons for the failure of a scan and notify the user, 2) Search on the collected information in the form of Aggregation search, which is a combination of queries. That is, the user will be able to search for various requests together, 3) The ability to set scanning parameters such as determining the range of IPs and scanning frequency, 4) The ability to adjust the rate of sending information according to the power of the scanning target so as not to disrupt the operation of the target services, and 5) Filtering metadata information at high speed. In the results section of this paper, in order to show the capabilities of the proposed engine, several scenarios such as the emergence and fixing of CVEs, the dispersion of web servers, the presence/absence of authentication in famous databases/data stores/protocols, and Cryptojacking/Ransomware detection in different geographical areas have been analyzed and investigated.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3425062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589403","Internet of Things (IoT);industrial control systems;search engine;Shodan","Search engines;IP networks;Filters;Internet;Data mining;Reconnaissance;Internet of Things;Industrial control","","","","38","CCBYNCND","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Internet of Things (IoT) is seen as a widely accepted technology that promotes sustainability through the interconnection of diverse computing sources for solving environmental problems. Previous studies on IoT have discussed interesting factors toward its adoption, but selecting a suitable IoT service provider (IoTSP) is an open challenge due to a diverse set of factors in practice. Driven by the challenge, in this article, a generalized fuzzy-based decision model is put forward for IoTSP selection, which is the prime objective of the study. Initially, a strength, weakness, opportunity, threat (SWOT) analysis is adopted to identify the crucial challenges in IoT adoption. Later, the relative significance of these challenges is calculated by adopting the regret/rejoice approach. Due to uncertainty, certain rating information of IoTSPs is missing that are rationally imputed by proposing an analytical approach. Rating matrices from experts are transformed into opinion vectors, and a prioritization algorithm is developed with query vector for rational personalized ordering of IoTSPs. Data for the study are acquired via questionnaire, which is filled by experts. The efficacy of the developed model is exemplified by using a real case study of IoTSP selection for pollution management in Chennai. Concerning the findings, mobility, security, and connectivity are the most vital factors for IoTSP selection. Results show that the proposed model is a viable tool for IoTSP selection and it is robust, unique, and stable compared to its counterparts.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2022.3204695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889803","Internet of Things;q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (qrof);query-based ranking;regret theory;sustainable transport","Internet of Things;Pollution;Monitoring;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Atmospheric modeling","","7","","69","IEEE","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Collaborative filtering (CF) turns out to be an effective solution to IoT service discovery. However, the traditional CF framework is facing the following challenges: inefficiency in learning the high-order interactions between users and IoT services and ineffectively making use of geographical location information. Moreover, deploying a CF framework in real-world distributed IoT systems poses another significant challenge in terms of reliability assurance and privacy protection. For bridging this gap, we propose an innovative integrated collaborative filtering framework (ICF) with incorporating the location-aware quality of IoT services into a heterogeneous graph embedding model. Meanwhile, a Geohash-based privacy-preservation mechanism is introduced to encoding the location information into a short string for protecting the sensitive location information. The proposed ICF framework is an integrated architecture combining advanced graph embedding learning and heterogeneous side information. And a joint objective optimization function is designed in the graph embedding learning to qualify automatic IoT service features. In this way, the hidden user-service interaction information and location-aware quality semantic features can be explored in an effective and reliable way. Furthermore, the learned location-aware quality embedding vector is incorporated to discover the reliable services among all IoT services with the mini-batch online clustering-based CF algorithm.

It can take the time that may not be acceptable for many IoT applications and requires resources that may not be available in many IoT devices. A categorisation of these services into their application domains can reduce the search space and offer an efficient and scalable service search. Recently, in many fields, such as short text messages and categorisation of IoT service specifications, generative probabilistic models, like Topic modelling, are being used. Generally, IoT service descriptions are short and sparse. Existing work on IoT services categorisation is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), but it does not perform well in short and sparse texts. Also, IoT services categorisation has few specific issues, which are not well addressed by existing short texts-specific topic modelling approaches. In this paper, we identify these issues and quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate how well a set of selected short texts-specific topic modelling approaches perform as IoT service categorisers against these issues. The results show that these approaches do not perform well in a corpus of noisy APIs descriptions and heterogeneous service descriptions. Also, they do not support domain identification of services, which is essential in domain-based service search. We conclude that integrating an appropriate and comprehensive knowledge base (i.e., domain ontology) could minimise noise and address IoT's APIs and service descriptions' heterogeneity. More importantly, it can identify the domains of those APIs and services.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395093","Large-scale IoT;service discovery;service oriented computing;topic modelling","Computational modeling;Ontologies;Probabilistic logic;Internet of Things;Resource management;Noise measurement;Task analysis","","1","","48","CCBY","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Regarding the constantly changing network dynamics, input traffic of service components is considered at the lower granularity level of messages based on the communication between each VNF and corresponding sensors via IoT gateways. From the algorithm perspective, the specific topology of multiple edge clouds is leveraged to improve the solution. In this paper, we present an NFV-based high-level architecture for a system that enables the deployment of IoT services across multiple edges and clouds. We formulate the VNF placement problem using a non-convex Integer Programming model.

We provide an exhaustive variable selection study (i.e., a selection of the soundscapes indicators) to a well-known dataset (emo-soundscapes). We consider linear soundscape emotion models for two soundscapes descriptors: arousal and valence. Several ranking schemes and procedures for selecting the number of variables are applied.

In this paper, we present a decentralized and revised content-centric networking (CCN)-based MEC service deployment/discovery protocol and platform. We organized a gateway in every area according to a three-tiered hierarchical MEC network topology to reduce computing overhead at the centralized controller. We revised CCN to introduce a protocol to help SP deploy their service on MEC node and assist MEC node discover services in neighboring nodes. By using our proposed protocol, MEC nodes can deploy or discover the requested service instances in the proximity of IoT devices to reduce transmission delay. We also present a mathematical model to calculate the round trip time to guarantee quality of service. Numerical experiments measure the performance of our proposed method with various mobile IoT device services. The results show that the proposed service deployment protocol and platform reduce the average service delay by up to 50% compared to legacy cloud.

An overview of the smart city concept and the three-tier architecture that emerges through the digitalization of cities is presented first, together with the main challenges in attaining coherent smart city service environments that can avoid fragmentation, ensure scalability, and allow reuse. The three major enablers that are identified in this direction are 1) a semantic functional description of city objects, representing physical devices or abstract services; 2) a distributed service directory that embodies available city services for service lookup and discovery; and 3) planning tools for selecting and chaining basic services to compose new complex services. For each of these, a high-level overview of the available tools and results from the research literature are provided as well as the relevant standards.

In this article, we conduct the first empirical study to shed light on the (in)security of EoL devices. Our study performs two types of analysis, including the liveness analysis and the vulnerability analysis. The first one aims to detect the scale of EoL devices that are still alive in the wild in the long term. The second one is to evaluate the vulnerabilities existing in (active) EoL devices. We analyzed 894 EoL models from three vendors (i.e., D-Link, Tp-Link, and Netgear) for more than two years. Our study reveals some worrisome facts that were unknown by the community. There exist more than three million active EoL devices, while more than one million of them have been alive for more than five years. Furthermore, more than half of the vulnerabilities are discovered after the EoL date. Although vendors may release security patches after the EoL date, the process is ad hoc and incomplete, with limited functionality. In summary, more than three million active EoL devices are vulnerable, and nearly half of them are threatened by high-risk vulnerabilities.

Accurate network traffic prediction is one of the key enablers for addressing these challenges. While there are methods for quantifying the complexity (predictability in timing, shape, and volume) of wide-scale aggregate traffic, they cannot be directly applied to IoT traffic as they do not account for the heterogeneity of IoT devices. Lacking an effective complexity characterization for IoT traffic, network traffic administrators are under-informed on the impacts of IoT device-type traffic on their networks. In this work, the complexity of IoT traffic is examined from two novel perspectives, the information-theoretic approach of Lempel–Ziv, a foundational algorithm in lossless data compression, and in the distribution of spectral components of the Fourier transform. Based on these perspectives, two new measures of IoT network traffic complexity are proposed. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mathematical framework to permit a formal comparison of new and existing methods. The new framework additionally verifies that the new metrics satisfy desirable properties for a measure of complexity. In a comprehensive empirical study, our results, when compared with existing approaches, exceed all others in behavioral resolution, convergence rate, physical interpretability, and algorithmic stability, under severely heterogeneous conditions.

Next, to minimize the impact of false rejection, the approach considers the possible deviation in each element of the feature vector and then stores the data in possible locations using the predefined threshold. Besides, to reduce the false acceptance rate, linking of the modalities has been done for every individual data. The modality linking thus helps in carrying out an efficient search of the queried data, thereby minimizing the false acceptance and rejection rate. Experiments on a chimeric iris and fingerprint bimodal database resulted in an average of 95% reduction in the search space at a hit rate of 98%. The results suggest that the proposed indexing scheme has the potential to substantially reduce the response time without compromising the accuracy of identification.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3225518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9966933","Feature fusion;fingerprint;iris;multimodal biometric data indexing;search space reduction","Biometrics (access control);Indexing;Iris recognition;Feature extraction;Medical services;Databases;Ecosystems","","2","","26","IEEE","30 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a machine learning aided information management scheme is proposed for handling data to ensure uninterrupted user request service. The neural learning process gains control over service attributes and data response to abruptly assign resources to the incoming requests in the data plane. The learning process operates in the data plane, where requests and responses for service are instantaneous. This facilitates the smoothing of the learning process to decide upon the possible resources and more precise service delivery without duplication.

This is particularly suitable for non-time sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as telemetry, smart metering, and soon. The proposed architecture reduces the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based schemes without relegating the data rate. In the proposed scheme, we implement joint code-frequency-index modulation (CFIM) by considering code and frequency domains for index-modulation (IM). After introducing and analysing the structure of the CFIM, we derive closed-form expressions of the bit error rate (BER) performance over Rayleigh fading channels and we provide extensive simulation results to validate our outcomes. To better exhibit the particularities of the proposed scheme, the PAPR and complexity are thoroughly examined. The obtained results show that the PAPR is reduced compared to conventional OFDM-like IM-based schemes. Therefore, the proposed system is more likely to operate in the linear regime, which can in turn be implemented into low-cost devices with cost effective amplifiers. In addition, the concept is extended to synchronous multi-user communication networks, where full functionality is obtained by using orthogonal spreading codes. With the characteristics demonstrated in this work, the proposed system would constitute an exceptional nominee for IoT applications where low-complexity, low-power consumption and high data rate are paramount.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2933056","Dr. Richard J.

However, a large number of software services is likely to cause performance issues when discovering software services. The distributed organisation of services information improves discovery performance. Existing research proposes to organise services information according to service location, domains, or city context, keeping that organisation constant under an assumption that cities do not change. However, cities are dynamic environments where entities interact, causing events that in turn, effect changes in the city. The organisation of services information must evolve or it will become outdated, negatively impacting discovery performance. We propose a self-adaptive service model for smart cities to support service discovery. This model adapts the organisation of services information according to city events. We introduce a self-adaptive architecture that keeps track of the discovery metrics and moves information about services between registries to maintain the discovery efficiency. We evaluate the proposed model in simulated environments and a real IoT testbed. Results show that our model outperforms competitors when reactive adaptation is triggered by a specific event. However, proactive adaptation needs further research.

Due to the limited battery capacity, the nonaccessible/abandoned nodes demand more energy to be reached or reintegrated to keep the network connected. When a specific tree topology for routing, called destination-oriented directed acyclic graphs (DODAGs), is used, isolated nodes spend maximum energy on the assigned task during data transformation from the sensor field to the DODAG root. The nodes closer to the DODAG root need to rely on faraway nodes and resource-burden-constrained nodes to lead to the quick energy drain. It brings an idea of IoT network nodes in which an extra amount of energy provide to the longer time alive nodes. This article proposes an ARFOR-adaptive ranking fuzzy-based energy-efficient opportunistic routing protocol for sustainable IoT applications. The proposed protocol consists of a parent node (PN) that acts as a head node in a cluster to aggregate the packets to DODAG root; and a volunteer node (VN) acts as a forwarder to transfer the packets to PN with threshold energy limits to increase network lifetime during the transmission cycle. The proposed VN selection is based on fuzzy parameters, such as Canberra distance, residual energy, and threshold. The simulation outcomes depict that the ARFOR fairly justifies the network timeline requirement with maximum percentage area coverage. The percentage gain in terms of network lifetime is comparatively significant for a lower number of VN.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3098430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490677","Adaptive ranking;energy efficient;fuzzy;Internet of Things (IoT);opportunistic routing;sustainable","Internet of Things;Routing;Sensors;Routing protocols;Delays;Computer science;Computational modeling","","34","","30","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study presents an original and innovative solution to this issue by introducing a novel three-layered recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm. Aimed at optimizing QoS in the context of IoT service discovery, our method incorporates user requirements into its evaluation matrix. It also integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and a unique black widow optimization (BWO) algorithm, collectively facilitating the selection and composition of optimal services for specific tasks. This approach allows the RNN algorithm to identify the top- $K$  services based on QoS under varying network conditions. Our methodology’s novelty lies in implementing LSTM in the hidden layer and employing backpropagation through time (BPTT) for parameter updates, which enables the RNN to capture temporal patterns and intricate relationships between devices and services. Further, we use the BWO algorithm, which simulates the behavior of black widow spiders, to find the optimal combination of services to meet system requirements. This algorithm factors in both the attractive and repulsive forces between services to isolate the best candidate solutions. In comparison with existing methods, our approach shows superior performance in terms of latency, availability, and reliability. Thus, it provides an efficient and effective solution for service discovery and composition in IoT-based smart cities, bridging a significant gap in current research.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3303188","“Mobility and Training foR Beyond 5G Ecosystems (MOTOR5G)” which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme(grant numbers:861219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10210672","Black widow optimization (BWO) algorithm (BWO);Internet of Things (IoT);recurrent neural network (RNN);service discovery;smart cities","Quality of service;Internet of Things;Smart cities;Reliability;Scalability;Optimization;Complexity theory;Recurrent neural networks","","2","","38","CCBY","8 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the increasing number of urban trees put pressure on maintenance and public safety.

At this point in time, there is no known research on manifesting guidance on automated tree health assessment. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) proliferates the deployment of wireless sensors and networks. A concept of the IoT trees is raised to implement various sensors on the trees for automated health monitoring and assessment. In this paper, an urban tree health index (UTHI) is first developed to indicate the health of urban IoT trees. The index will facilitate preventive measures on urban trees. To construct the indexing model, seven (7) dynamic (time-series) features and seven (7) static features are extracted to explore the ambient effects on urban tree health. Afterward, a heterogeneous neural network (HNN) for UTHI modeling is developed to adopt the heterogeneous feature structure. In HNN, the dynamic features are analyzed in the gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer and the static features are analyzed in a hidden layer. The novel fusion layer then aggregates the outputs computed from those layers and further explores unseen correlations among all features. The experimental result verifies that the HNN-based modeling achieves high accuracy and model fitness with the error rate of less than 5%. In addition, the HNN achieves 34% to 66% improvement of accuracy in comparison with the other machine learning algorithms. The supremacy of the developed model is that all indexing features can be predefined or monitored by the IoT sensors, thus rendering an automated and economic urban tree management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2918060","Innovation and Technology Fund(grant numbers:9443004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718610","Tree health assessment;heterogeneous neural network;modeling","Feature extraction;Vegetation;Indexing;Sensors;Monitoring;Computational modeling","","14","","23","OAPA","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the introduction of MANET potentially makes the system more prone to attacks due to its lack of centralized management, weak connectivity, and resource constraints. To enhance the network robustness to intentional attacks, the critical nodes of the MANET-IoT network should be firstly identified and then protected. Most of the existing methods for identifying critical nodes usually focus on static networks or a single topology snapshot in dynamic networks without considering the correlation between topology snapshots, which cannot effectively deal with the dynamic changes in the topology of MANET-IoT networks. In this paper, a dynamic critical node identification (DCNI) method is proposed. First, we propose a comprehensive metric to measure the node importance in the topology snapshot. Then, we introduce a sliding time window to filter out the topology snapshots which have a close correlation with the current snapshot, and fuse the importance values of the same node in different topology snapshots. Finally, the critical nodes are selected based on the ranking result of fused importance. Thereafter, the port hopping mechanism could be applied to the critical nodes for enhancing network defense capability. The simulation results show that the proposed method is more effective in identifying critical nodes than existing static methods in MANET-IoT networks, and the port hopping mechanism can improve network defense significantly to denial of service (DoS) attacks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9217466","MANET-IoT network;topology snapshot;critical node identification;enhanced network defense","Topology;Mobile computing;Network topology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Measurement","","19","","54","CCBY","8 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multi-objective optimization method based on the ratio analysis (MOORA) is useful in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for ranking the alternatives. The statistical aggregation (SA) method has been used to assign weights to security authentication features in comparison to entropy method. In this paper, we identify weights for authentication features using the proposed SA method. Moreover, we evaluate the accuracy rates of the proposed model using entropy method. Finally, we ranked out the alternatives of authentication features using the MOORA approach. In fact, the entropy weight values came against the initial value of the objects in which the accuracy was 15% which is not suitable to this problem while the accuracy of the SA is 85%. Hence, the accuracy improvement is approximately 70 % using the SA method. This method is applicable for finding the weights of the objects based on initial values by MCDM approaches. We study the key security authentication which is the preserving of confidentiality, integrity, and availability that are the prime objectives for security of an IoT device. Furthermore, challenges are preserving the selected attributes through any approach, as discussed in the literature, adds to the complexity of IoT device security.

Recently, instantaneous signal power (ISP)-based ranking has been widely adopted by the receiver to determine the signal decoding order in NOMA. However, this ranking neglects the data rate requirement of each user, which poses a significant impact on the reliability of NOMA. This letter puts forward the concept of Relative ISP (RISP), defined as a form of ISP to target-data-rate (TDR) ratio. A new ranking scheme, namely RISP-based ranking, is proposed to improve ISP-based ranking to consider the TDR of each user when determining the signal decoding order. Analysis and simulations demonstrate a surprising outage performance gain realized by the proposed scheme, as it is designed based on channel gain and data rate requirement of each user, rather than purely considering channel gain.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2023.3323544","Joint Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085UD08); Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:202004a05020004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10275119","Non-orthogonal multiple access;user ranking;reliability;outage probability","NOMA;Receivers;Decoding;Signal to noise ratio;Interference cancellation;Complexity theory;Reliability","","","","21","IEEE","10 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Internal designs for each of these models is highly complex, and varies in terms of quantitative & qualitative performance measures. This is due to their variation in terms of design nuances, functional advantages, context-based limitations, and possible deployment-specific future scopes. Due to this variation, it is highly ambiguous to select these models for performance-specific IoT deployments. Moreover, these models also vary in terms of security level, Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, scalability performance, computational complexity, deployment costs, and other performance metrics. Thus, to identify optimum models, researchers & network designers are required to test & validate multiple security models for their deployments. Due to which, the cost & time to market for IoT devices is increased, thereby affecting viability of IoT products. To overcome these selection issues, an empirical survey of different IoT security models including block-chains, encryption techniques, hashing models, privacy preservation techniques, machine learning based security methods, etc. are discussed in this text. This text also discusses various attack mitigation models that provide node-level security, network-level security, physical security, & route-level security. This discussion will assist in initially evaluating different operating characteristics of these models, which will allow readers to identify most suited models for their application-specific use cases. This article also assesses the models’ performance in terms of computational latency, energy consumption, security levels, deployment complexity, and scalability measures. These metrics are compared between different security models, which will further assist readers to identify optimum models for their performance-specific use cases. To further assist in model selection, this text proposes evaluation of a novel IoT Security Performance Rank (ISRP), that combines various performance metrics to form a singular rank which can be used to describe overall performance of these models. Readers will be able to consider optimal security approaches for new and current IoT installations based on this ranking.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3234632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10007827","IoT;security;blockchain;QoS;medical signal detection;energy;attacks;data;route;physical;privacy","Security;Medical services;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Blockchains;Data models;Monitoring;Quality of service;Signal detection;Remote monitoring","","13","","137","CCBYNCND","5 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the dense deployment of small cells with fractional frequency reuse in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based H-CRANs increases intra- and inter-cell interference, turning the resource allocation into a more challenging problem. In general, the macro cell users are considered as the legacy users, whereas the cellular IoT devices and small cell users share the macro cell users' resource blocks in an underlaid approach. In this paper, we investigate an underlaid approach of resource allocation for small and macro cell users to improve the energy efficiency (EE) in H-CRANs. The solution approaches are derived with the Dinkelbach, Lagrange multiplier and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) methods by considering the maximum power, resource block allocation, fronthaul capacity and quality of service (QoS) constraints of macro cell users. A two-step energy efficient underlaid cellular IoT (UC-IoT) supported H-CRAN method is proposed and evaluated with the overlaid cellular IoT (OC-IoT) supported H-CRAN and underlaid H-CRAN without cellular IoT devices.

Edge computing provides an effective computing paradigm for executing AI tasks, where large numbers of AI tasks can be offloaded to the edge servers. Most of the existing works focus on achieving efficient computing offload through improving the Quality of Service (QoS), such as reducing the average server-side delay. However, we show that those efforts are inefficient due to the heterogeneous impact of delays on users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Inspired by the observations, in this article, we reconsider the scheduling method from an orthometric perspective, i.e., improving the QoE by designing a QoE-aware service-enhancement strategy for edge AI applications. Besides, multiple AI algorithms are utilized in our service model to execute the same type of tasks concurrently, thus meeting users' heterogeneity requirements of accuracy and delays. Specifically, for the online arriving AI tasks, we optimize the task allocation and scheduling strategy according to the QoE sensitivity of each task. The model can be formulated as the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Hence, we then propose an efficient two-phase scheduling strategy for this problem. The results of comprehensive emulations validate that our model can effectively improve the average QoE of users and achieve a higher task completion ratio.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2996422","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19B2024,61772544); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFB1800203,2018YFE0207600); Tianjin Science and Technology Foundation(grant numbers:18ZXJMTG00290); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9097834","Artificial intelligence (AI);computation offloading;edge computing;Internet of Things (IoT);Quality of Experience (QoE)","Task analysis;Quality of experience;Delays;Artificial intelligence;Servers;Quality of service;Processor scheduling","","10","","29","IEEE","21 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since then, it has been used in different IoT applications. Though RPL considerably deals with IoT network requirements, there are still some open problems to solve, since it was not initially designed for IoT applications. In this paper, we address the problem of packet loss and power depletion in an RPL-based network under heavy and highly dynamic load. We address this problem in three steps: First, we present a context-aware objective function (CAOF), which computes the rank, considering the context of the node. CAOF also avoids thundering herd phenomenon by gradual shifting from a high rank value toward the real rank value. Second, we present a new routing metric, known as context-aware routing metric (CARF) which considers the status of remaining power and queue utilization of parent chain toward the root in a recursive manner while lessening the effect of upstream parents as it gets farther down the path. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that this metric leads to a better decision about the proper parent in a network with high traffic dynamicity, rather than deciding merely based on the parent rank. Third, we present a new parent selection mechanism, which selects the best parent based on CARF and some other metrics while avoiding routing loops by a simple yet effective countermeasure. Evaluation results reveal improvements in network lifetime while decreasing packet loss in comparison with standard specification of RPL.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8334403","Context-aware routing;Internet of Things;heavy load;network lifetime;packet loss;dynamic load","Routing protocols;Routing;Linear programming;Packet loss;Logic gates","","63","","79","OAPA","9 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Quadrature reflection modulation (QRM) is a promising contender among index modulation (IM)-based techniques for implementing RIS-based backscatter communications (RIS-BackCom). In this paper, we demonstrate that the error performance of RIS-QRM heavily relies on the employed indexing scheme, which configures each RIS element into one of the two orthogonally-reflecting modes of QRM to encode the transmitted data onto the reflection pattern of RIS elements. In this context, we present an efficient guideline for designing indexing schemes that ensure the resulting channel-dependent QRM symbols are evenly spaced with maximum separation. Following this guideline, we propose two specific indexing techniques: the incremental and uniform indexing schemes, both of which substantially enhance the error performance of RIS-QRM without increasing detection complexity. We derive a closed-form expression for the bit error probability (BEP) of RIS-QRM with the incremental indexing scheme. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity detector for RIS-BackCom systems employing RIS-QRM.

In addition, energy harvestable or wireless-powered wearable devices are envisioned to empower the edge intelligence in IoT applications. However, the intermittent energy supply and network connectivity of such devices in scenarios including remote areas and hard-to-reach regions such as in-body applications can limit the performance of edge computing-based IoT applications. Hence, deploying state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on such energy-constrained devices is not feasible due to their computational cost. Existing model compression methods, such as network pruning and quantization can reduce complexity, but these methods only work for fixed computational or energy requirements, which is not the case for edge devices with an intermittent energy source. In this work, we propose a pruning scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which can compress the CNN model adaptively according to the energy dictated by the energy management policy and accuracy requirements for IoT applications. The proposed energy policy uses predictions of energy to be harvested and dictates the amount of energy that can be used by the edge device for deep learning inference. We compare the performance of our proposed approach with existing state-of-the-art CNNs and data sets using different filter-ranking criteria and pruning ratios. We observe that by using DRL-driven pruning, the convolutional layers that consume relatively higher energy are pruned more as compared to their counterparts. Thereby, our approach outperforms existing approaches by reducing energy consumption and maintaining accuracy.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3219202","Science Foundation Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food, and Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland VistaMilk Research Centre(grant numbers:16/RC/3835); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937047","Artificial intelligence (AI);edge computing;energy efficiency;Internet of Things (IoT)","Internet of Things;Batteries;Performance evaluation;Edge computing;Convolutional neural networks;Computational modeling;Adaptation models","","10","","34","IEEE","3 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, scalability issues will arise from the search of the right object that can provide the desired service.

The underneath idea is that every object can look for the desired service using its friendships, in a distributed manner, with only local information. In the SIoT it is very important to set appropriate rules in the objects to select the right friends as these impact the performance of services developed on top of this social network. In this work, we addressed this issue by analyzing possible strategies for the benefit of overall network navigability. We first propose five heuristics, which are based on local network properties and that are expected to have an impact on the overall network structure. We then perform extensive experiments, which are intended to analyze the performance in terms of giant components, average degree of connections, local clustering, and average path length. Unexpectedly, we discovered that minimizing the local clustering in the network allowed for achieving the best results in terms of average path length.

Therefore, the Fermatean by fuzzy decision opinion score method (F-FDOSM) for prioritizing the powerful countermeasure technique against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is the best approach because it employs the most efficient MCDM ranking technique. Nonetheless, the FDOSM method needs to weight the criteria before being submitted for the ranking process. In order to address this theoretical challenge, the Criteria-importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) technique can be applied as an effective MCDM weighting technique to offer an explicit weight for a set of criteria with no inconsistency based on the standard deviation, which uses correlation analysis to determine the relevance of each criterion. Objectives: This research proposes a Fermatean-FDOSM framework for evaluating DoS A-CTs in the context of MPSoCs-based IoT and CRITIC techniques to weight the criteria. Methods: The methodology is presented in three phases. Firstly, a proposed countermeasure techniques dataset was collected that included eighteen defense approaches (e.g., Sniffer, SeRA, and RLAN) based on thirteen criteria (e.g., size, power, latency, and effectiveness…etc.). Then, the Decision matrix (DM) was built based on an intersection of the countermeasure techniques as an alternative and MPSoC design and performance criteria. Then, the multi-criteria decision-making methods were integrated. The CRITIC method for criteria weighting was followed by the development of the Fermatean-FDOSM method for ranking. Results: (1) CRITIC weighting shows that MPSoC NoC Routing Algorithm (XY and YX) is the highest weight criterion, whereas latency (clock/cycle) is the less weight criterion. (2) The Fermatean-FDOSM-based group ranking shows that the Collision Point Router Detection (CPRD) countermeasure technique is the first-ranked alternative compared to the Secure Model Checkers (SMCs) approach. (3) The DoS A-CTs priority ranks were subjected to a systematic ranking that was confirmed by solid correlation results throughout thirteen criterion weight values. A comparison with recent studies confirmed the feasibility of the proposed framework. Conclusion: The results of this research are expected to provide a specific understanding and guide for those who want to engage in MPSoCs-based IoT and NoC communication security research with decision theory.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3232395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001827","Network-on-chip security;multiprocessor system-on-chip;denial-of-service attack;countermeasure techniques;multi-criteria decision making;CRITIC;fermatean fuzzy set FDOSM","Security;Decision making;Network-on-chip;Correlation;Switches;IP networks;Routing protocols","","13","","91","CCBY","28 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These devices pose a significant security risk to consumers because the devices are exposed to mobile applications and cloud-based services with known security vulnerabilities. Most current home consumer devices provide little or no information about the level of security they afford. Since most consumers are not tech-savvy, it is currently difficult for a consumer to make an informed decision about which consumer device model (e.g., smart television model) has the best security. Hence, consumers need an objective security ranking of each type (e.g., security cameras) of home consumer devices. This paper proposes a novel methodology to systematically build such security rankings for home consumer devices. The proposed methodology can be applied by utilizing data from any security assessment study. The paper discusses previous efforts in applying Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank security risks in general. The paper also presents a systematic survey of security vulnerabilities of smart home consumer devices when viewed from an IoT lens. Using the proposed methodology, a case study, employing an AHP model for ranking commonly used home consumer devices including home theatres, security cameras, smart lighting, smart speakers, video surveillance, smart switches, home automation systems, home security systems, smart routers, wireless doorbell cameras, and home audio systems, was developed. Relative security rankings for each type of consumer device were derived from the AHP model. According to the AHP model, network security was the primary driver of smart home device security with a priority of 0.6893 while application security had the least priority of 0.0591. Critical Vulnerabilities were the most important for device security (priority=0.4397), Man-in-The-Middle attacks for network security (priority=0.2019), exploitable services for cloud security (priority=0.26), and sensitive data for application security (0.7626). The AHP model was internally consistent (Consistency Ratio < 0.1). Sensitivity analysis showed that the AHP model was robust against pairing assumptions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3148140","Open Access Program from the American University of Sharjah; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698229","AHP;consumer applications;cloud computing;home consumer devices;Internet of Things;network security;smart home","Security;Smart homes;Systematics;Analytic hierarchy process;TV;Network security;Internet of Things","","23","","138","CCBY","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Extensive analysis and experiments show that: i) Argus is secure; ii) its Level 2 is 10x as scalable and computationally efficient as work using Attribute-based Encryption, Level 3 is 10x as efficient as work using Paring-based Cryptography; iii) it is fast and agile for satisfactory user experience, costing 0.25 s to discover 20 Level 1 devices, and 0.63 s for Level 2 or Level 3 devices.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3012875","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1652276); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152166","Internet of Things;service discovery;security;privacy","Privacy;Servers;Scalability;Public key;Mobile computing","","1","","50","IEEE","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the number of criteria increases, the skyline presumes excessive data items, which yield a meaningless result. To address this curse of dimensionality, we proposed a $k$-dominant skyline in which the number of skyline members was reduced by relaxing the restriction on the number of dimensions, considering the uncertainty of data. Specifically, each data item was associated with a probability of appearance, which represented the probability of becoming a member of the $k$-dominant skyline. As data items appear continuously in data streams, the corresponding $k$-dominant skyline may vary with time. Therefore, an effective and rapid mechanism of updating the $k$-dominant skyline becomes crucial. Herein, we proposed two time-efficient schemes, Middle Indexing (MI) and All Indexing (AI), for $k$-dominant skyline in distributed edge-computing environments, where irrelevant data items can be effectively excluded from the compute to reduce the processing duration. Furthermore, the proposed schemes were validated with extensive experimental simulations. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed MI and AI schemes reduced the computation time by approximately 13% and 56%, respectively, compared with the existing method.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2023.3326295","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 109-2221-E-027-095-MY3,MOST 110-2222-E-035-004-MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298037","Pareto-optimal; $k$ -dominant skyline;skyline;uncertain data;data streams","Streams;Indexing;Artificial intelligence;Probabilistic logic;Optimization;Distributed databases;Uncertainty","","","","","IEEE","26 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Unlike previous work, our proposed scheme is designed for packet-level de-duplication to support any kinds of network from the current Internet to emerging networks. We also present a new fast chunking method and a new indexing scheme that enable multiple engine instances to execute in parallel. We implement the de-duplication engine, and experimental results show that our proposed scheme can remove up to 65 percent of the packet contents in a real campus network.

Recently, an indexed modulation (IM) technique provides an interesting tradeoff between EE and SE. Data can be conveyed through the combination of subcarriers pattern that can be divided between activated/non-activated subcarriers in the frequency domain. Maximum SE can be attained at half subcarrier activation, hence producing symbols with half energy of the conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. In this paper, alternatively, the new concept of sparsely indexing modulation (SIM) on overall subcarrier space is clarified. Sparse (few) subcarrier activations provide much higher EE, while the combinatorial indexing of the sparse subcarriers on the overall subcarriers as a single group spans huge combinatorial space that provides approximately the same SE of the plain OFDM system. The fallacy of indexing difficulty on overall subcarrier space without grouping is resolved. Moreover, a further SE improvement is suggested by introducing permutation-based indexing and combinatorial indexing on over-complete dictionaries. Sparsely indexing represents the cornerstone, which enables compressive sensing tools to enforce IM gains. Based on the conducted simulations, the proposed SIM scheme outperforms the conventional OFDM system in terms of the error performance, the peak-to-average power ratio, and the EE with the same spectral efficiency without channel coding complexity. The proposed SIM scheme is considered one of the energy saving-oriented modulations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663599","Index modulation;sparse index modulation;OFDM;OFDM-IM;double data/channel sparsity;critical sparsity;combinatorial/permutational indexing;overcomplete/non-orthogonal dictionary indexing;green modulation","Indexing;OFDM;Spectral efficiency;Frequency-domain analysis;Quadrature amplitude modulation","","19","","69","OAPA","8 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This representative optimizes the test of the following hypothesis: the query is independent from any vector in the memory unit versus the query is a simple perturbation of one of the stored vectors. Compared to exhaustive search, our approach finds the most similar database vectors significantly faster without a noticeable reduction in search quality.

The proposed scheme exploits the temporal correlation of observed data with a transmission suppression control executed according to the previous top– ${k}$  set, which is notified from the sink to wake–up receivers by a designated signaling. Furthermore, the validations on the estimated top– ${k}$  set are conducted by exploiting two different types of wake–up control: identity–based wake–up and content–based wake–up.

According to recent research results, a further feature these devices may acquire is social behavior; this latter offers enormous possibilities for fast and trustworthy service discovery, although it requires new orchestration policies of DTs at the network edge. This work addresses the dynamic placement of DTs with social capabilities [social digital twins (SDTs)] at the edge, by providing an optimal solution under IoT device mobility and by accounting for edge network deployment specifics, types of devices, and their social peculiarities. The optimization problem is formulated as a particular case of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP); also, an approximation algorithm is proposed and two relaxation techniques are applied to reduce computation complexity. Results show that the proposed placement policy ensures a latency among SDTs up to 1.4 times lower than the one obtainable with a traditional proximity-based only placement while still guaranteeing appropriate proximity between physical devices and their virtual counterparts.

The traditional cloud-oriented data service architecture has been inapplicable to the state time-varying and privacy-sensitive entity data in IoT due to long response delay and the risk of privacy leakage for the entities and users, respectively. The edge-based architecture lacks global service function although it can alleviate problems with cloud services. Moreover, existing demand-oriented data service ignores the characteristics of “thousands of people have thousands of faces” and the implicit intents of users, which results in limited service quality and weak user experience. To solve the above problems, a personalized secure demand-oriented data service scheme is proposed. Specifically, an edge-cloud collaborative architecture is designed to realize privacy-preserving, timely response, and personalized search combining the advantages of edge and cloud. To achieve the personalized service for IoT users, a time span fused personalized ranking method (TSFPR) is proposed to deeply perceive individual demands via mining user preferences with temporal evolution characteristics. Finally, an edge-cloud collaborative personalized secure data service approach (ECPSS) oriented different search modes is presented to achieve encryption data matching and personalized reranking, thereby improving the service quality of the IoT system synthetically.

However, the availability of ongoing energy heads for fog computing servers is one of the constraints for IoT applications because transmitting the huge quantity of the data generated using IoT devices will produce network bandwidth overhead and slow down the responsive time of the statements analyzed. In this article, an energy-aware model basis on the marine predators algorithm (MPA) is proposed for tackling the task scheduling in fog computing (TSFC) to improve the QoSs required by users. In addition to the standard MPA, we proposed the other two versions. The first version is called modified MPA (MMPA), which will modify MPA to improve their exploitation capability by using the last updated positions instead of the last best one. The second one will improve MMPA by the ranking strategy based reinitialization and mutation toward the best, in addition to reinitializing, the half population randomly after a predefined number of iterations to get rid of local optima and mutated the last half toward the best-so-far solution. Accordingly, MPA is proposed to solve the continuous one, whereas the TSFC is considered a discrete one, so the normalization and scaling phase will be used to convert the standard MPA into a discrete one. The three versions are proposed with some other metaheuristic algorithms and genetic algorithms based on various performance metrics such as energy consumption, makespan, flow time, and carbon dioxide emission rate. The improved MMPA could outperform all the other algorithms and the other two versions.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3001067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115234","Energy;fog computing (FC);makespan;marine predators algorithm (MPA);metaheuristic;task scheduling","Task analysis;Edge computing;Scheduling;Optimization;Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Quality of service","","104","","29","IEEE","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SIoT also integrates the concepts of social networking and IoT into collaborative edge computing (CEC), the so-called CEC-based SIoT architecture. In closer proximity, IoT devices self-organize into a CEC-based SIoT computing cluster and provide social device-to-device (S-D2D) services, such as computation offloading, service discovery, and content delivery. In the CEC-based SIoT, however, cooperation based on social connections leads to a problem called social and spatial physical trade-off. This problem is also referred to as the mismatch problem, which arises because the spatial neighbors in the social layer cannot always be related. The spatial distance thus calls for additional multi-hop transmissions. This work presents a novel solution called 3-D-social identifier structure (3-D-SIS) model. The 3-D-SIS model is based on 3-D social space (3-D-SS) and considers social ties and physical connections (i.e., intra-neighbor) of the SIoT devices and utilizes a 3-D structure to evaluate that relationship. Moreover, it minimizes the end-to-end delay and communication cost to address the mismatch problem. To validate the performance of the (3-D-SIS) model, we use the real traces of social networks (INFOCOM06). The results show that the 3-D-SIS selects the best neighbor in S-D2D communication and improves performance in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2021.3064716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382791","Collaborative edge computing (CEC);social device-to-device (social D2D) communication;social Internet of Things (IoT) (SIoT)","Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Social networking (online);Physical layer;Peer-to-peer computing;Collaboration","","11","","34","IEEE","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A fully scalable and adaptive approach is developed by applying the SEMMA data mining process. This approach relies on three data artifacts: raw data from Censys, a mapping table with firmware versions, and a keyword search list. The results confirm the heterogeneity of connected IoT devices and show that only 2.45 percent of the IoT devices “in the wild” run the latest available firmware.

This issue is all the more valid in complex environments, such as smart cities, in which exceedingly large amounts of heterogeneous sensor data are collected, and in which platforms and stakeholders should also be able to interact and cooperate. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to move towards the creation of open IoT ecosystems to support efficient smart city service integration, discovery and composition. This paper contributes to the specifications of such an ecosystem, which has been developed as part of the EU's H2020 bIoTope project. The novelty of this ecosystem compared with the current literature is threefold: (i) it is based on the extensive use of open communication and data standards, notably O-MI and O-DF standards, that foster technical, syntactic and semantic interoperability over domains; (ii) it proposes an innovative service marketplace for data/service publication, discovery and incentivization; (iii) it integrates security functionalities at the IoT gateway level.

Recently, research has shown that adversarial attacks have put ML-based models at risk. This problem is exacerbated in an IoT environment because of the absence of adequate security measures. Consequently, it is crucial to evaluate the strength of such malware detectors using powerful adversarial samples. The existing adversarial sample generation strategies either rely on high-level image features or an unfiltered feature set, making it challenging to determine which feature modifications are crucial in evading malware detection systems, without compromising the malware functionality. This encourages us to propose an evasion framework named IF-MalEvade, based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that effectively generates fully-working, malware samples with several effective perturbations such as header Section manipulation and benign bytes insertion. The DRL framework selects a few suitable action sequences to change malicious samples, thus allowing our malware samples to bypass various black-box ML based malware detectors and the detection search engines of VirusTotal, while maintaining the executability and malicious behavior of the original malware samples. The neural networks of GAN take in the unfiltered feature set of malware dataset and using minimax objective function yields a set of useful features that are subsequently used by the DRL agent to make effective changes. Experimental results illustrated that by utilizing the influential features in sequence of transformations, the adversarial samples generated by our model outperformed the state-of-the-art evasion models with an impressive evasion rate. Additionally, the detection rate of well-known machine learning models was also brought down to up to 97%.

Unlike traditional applications, many applications envisioned for IoT networks may have different and sometimes conflicting requirements. In this context, the underlying routing protocol requires to provide quality of service (QoS) for multipurpose IoT and is inevitable. However, the routing approach in RPL is not efficient because default objective functions (OFs) rely on a single metric, which can result in a tradeoff in routing performance, particularly for multipurpose IoT that enchant different QoS requirements in the same network. Although RPL specification allows the use of multiple metrics for parent selection, however, no specific guideline is defined for metric combinations. Besides, many studies have revealed that RPL encounters severe problems in large scale networks as it was mainly designed for low data traffic network. To address these problems, in this paper, we primarily focus on QoS differentiation by exploiting the multi-topology routing feature of the RPL standard. For this, we propose different OFs, which ensures the QoS differentiation at the network level by splitting the physical network virtually into multiple RPL Instances. Each Instance can incorporate different traffic by associating with differing OFs, and routed it through the corresponding virtual network topology. We also present a new parent selection framework based on a multi-attribute decision-making approach that addresses the single routing metric problem in RPL. The extensive simulation results verify that our multi-topology routing approach can support the QoS provisioning and is suitable for large scale networks as compared with standard RPL.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2995794","Institute for Information and Communication Technology Promotion (IITP); Korea Government Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2018-0-00508); Research Funds of Jeonbuk National University, in 2020; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9097219","Internet of Things;quality of service;low power and lossy networks;routing metrics;objective function;6LoWPAN;border router","Routing;Quality of service;Measurement;Network topology;Internet of Things;Routing protocols;Topology","","25","","77","CCBY","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to its interoperable nature, the integration of heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud radio access networks (CRANs), is performed at ease. This integration is managed using software-defined networks (SDNs) for managing the Quality of Service (QoS) experience of the users, irrespective of the application. This manuscript proposes the service virtualization and flow management framework (SVFMF) for the reliable utilization of resources in the 6G-cloud environment. The imbalance in a service request and response due to overloaded and idle virtual resources is addressed in this framework. For this purpose, this framework endorses service virtualization and user allocation modules for mitigating the drawbacks of imbalanced service allocations. Linear decision making of the service virtualization process helps to reduce the computation and service discovery by identifying overloaded services and performing a reallocation. The purpose of user allocation is to distribute the service requests to the idle service providers to reduce the prolonged wait time of the increasing user requests. The performance of the proposed framework is verified using experimental analyses, for the metrics service discovery and computation time, service failure ratio, and flows.

Aiming at solving this problem, a two-stage fault tolerance method is, thus, proposed. In the off-line stage, a LeaderRank-based manufacturing nodes ranking (LNR) algorithm is put forward to rank the manufacturing services according to their significance in fault tolerance. Replication strategies are employed only for critical services to achieve the tradeoff between fault tolerance effect and fault tolerance loss.

ReRAMbased search engines and neural network (NN) accelerators have grown significantly especially for IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a memristor-based voltage-resistance xnor (VR-XNOR) cell. The advantages of this cell are demonstrated through building a reconfigurable content-addressable memory (CAM) architecture that can support binary-CAM (BCAM) and ternary-CAM (TCAM) and enable approximate search operations. Moreover, the memristor-based VR-XNOR cell is utilized for binarized convolutional neural networks (CNN) with focus on the convolution operation. This is achieved by replacing the convolution module with XNOR-based filter banks. Simulations of the proposed architectures for search engine and feature extraction were carried out using VTEAM model in Cadence Virtuoso Analog Design Environment. The proposed filter bank architecture achieves a 1-ns extraction cycle time over N filters and produces multiple output feature maps in a single processing cycle.

In the literature of wireless control CPS, commonly assume that the system just have one controller and ignore the processing time on server. In this work we employ the edge computing, the controllers are facilitated by edge server and cloud server. The processing time of status update depends on the characteristic of different servers and processes. By taking into account such conditions, we mainly investigate how to choose the destination of status updates (i.e., edge server or cloud server) to minimize the average mean square error (MSE) of the entire system. To address this issue, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem and obtain the optimal scheduling policy. The threshold property of the optimal scheduling policy is proved, and a suboptimal policy is proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, the processing preemption mechanism is considered to schedule the status updates more flexibly, and its consistency property is proved.

This invokes the need to identify the appropriate vehicles, important for different urban sensing tasks based on their natural mobility. This paper address this problem of leveraging the self-decision making ability of a “smart vehicle” to measure its relative importance in the network. To do so, we present InfoRank as an information-centric algorithm for a vehicle to first autonomously rank different location-aware information. It then uses the information importance along its mobility pattern to find its importance in the network. We also present a selection algorithm to find the best ranked vehicles for urban sensing and vicinity monitoring to achieve a desired coverage within a limited budget. Our vehicle ranking system is the first step toward identifying the best information hubs to be used in the network for the efficient collection, storage, and distribution of urban sensory information. We evaluate InfoRank under a scalable simulation environment using realistic vehicular mobility traces. Results show that the proposed ranking system efficiently identified socially important vehicles in comparison to other ranking schemes.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2607151","French Ministry of Industry(grant numbers:ITEA2 11037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563399","Information-centric vehicular networking;urban sensing and monitoring","Vehicles;Sensors;Measurement;Social network services;Monitoring;Urban areas;Network topology","","11","","15","IEEE","8 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, data collected from sensors should be processed and analyzed nearly in real time. The classical algorithms have two main drawbacks: 1) they deal with unidimensional data and 2) they fail to assume limited information available in the stream data processing. In this article, new solutions are discussed and presented that detect anomalies in data streams nearly in real time. Specifically, we propose: 1) an event detection method used in unidimensional data streams and relying on the event strength function, which is an extension of the typical “True or False” decision-making scheme; 2) multiple-criteria event detection approaches based on the Dynamic Pareto Set, introducing a time-depending decision set; and 3) an anomaly detection method based on multicriteria temporal graphs, combining the dynamics of decision making and multicriteria.

Existing sensor service ranking mechanisms fail to maintain a trade-off between meeting application requirements and minimizing the scarce network resource consumption. Moreover, a common usage context of the sensor data is considered while ranking the sensor services for different application queries. This results in a large number of applications not able to meet their specific quality of service requirements. This paper proposes an energy-aware value of information based sensor service ranking mechanism that models the rank of a sensor service as a value of information attribute while taking into account its usage context in the corresponding application. Integration of the proposed ranking mechanism with existing gateway service suggests its efficiency in maintaining a trade-off between application specific quality of service requirements and overall energy consumption in the network. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms existing sensor service ranking mechanisms in terms of meeting applications' quality of service requirements.

However, IoT nodes are usually resources heterogeneous and subject to malicious attacks, such as the intentional delay of block verification and the transmission of invalid blocks. As a result, a random node-selection model for block transmission may lead to a low transmission rate and serious security risk. To solve the problem, this article proposes a rate-and-trust-based node selection model for block transmission. In our model, we calculate the block transmission rate of a node by the latency and connectivity among nodes and its trust value by its historical transmission and verification behaviors. On this basis, we propose a PageRank-based optimization algorithm for node selection that makes a tradeoff between the transmission rate and the security risk. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods, including Bitcoin network, Ethereum network, and BlockP2P-EP protocol.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3210197","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872006); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, SAR(grant numbers:0062/2020/A2,0076/2022/A2); Startup Foundation for New Talents of NUIST; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908496","Block transmission;blockchain;Internet of Things (IoT);node selection;trust","Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Internet of Things;Security;Delays;Behavioral sciences;Bandwidth","","6","","50","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The privacy leakage problem also becomes an essential security issue that challenges the management and authentication of these private information, which even restricts the communication efficiency in different “things.”With the occurrence of serious information security incidents, such as the Facebook data breach event in March 2018, more and more attention has been taken into protecting private information from leakage or misuse. The existing private information protection mechanisms are mostly built on the basis of data encryption, access control, or user authentication, bearing two shortcomings: (1) strictly protecting data but sacrificing the data usage efficiency; and (2) rare consideration of the related application scenario information. In this paper, a privacy information protection scheme is proposed, where private data is protected differently based on the data attributes and application scenarios, ensuring that the private data is “properly protected”. We first investigate the specific attributes of private data based on the search engine (Google) in different application scenarios, such as the data importance and dependence. Based on these attributes, private data are divided into four security domains in a given application scenario, which is further protected by applying different protection policies. By implementing the proposed scheme, it has been demonstrated that our protection scheme can balance well between the security and usage convenience of private information.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885073","National Natural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China(grant numbers:61702090,61702084); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:20170540319,201602261); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N162410002,N161704001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8563040","Privacy data;privacy protection scheme;proper protection","Data privacy;Privacy;Search engines;Communication channels;Authentication;Encryption","","3","","13","OAPA","5 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The studied trends focus on the country percentage distribution and the usage of ICS protocols. The results show that all studied countries, except the United States, have decreased their percentage of world total ICS devices. We suspect that this does not represent the real story, as companies are getting better at hiding their devices from online crawlers. Our results also show that the usage of old ICS protocols is increasing. One of the explanations is that industrial devices, running old communication protocols, are increasingly getting connected to the Internet. In addition to the trend study, we evaluate Shodan by studying the time it takes for Shodan to index one of our devices on several networks.

However, the gradual accumulation of reviews has caused an issue associated with information redundancy. Therefore, recommending helpful reviews for consumers has become an urgent problem. Current research on the helpfulness of reviews is mostly at the level of analyzing influencing factors, and few studies have focused on the problem of ranking the helpfulness of reviews. Taking film reviews as the research object, we proposed a SO-ILES TODIM method (a TODIM method based on the intuitive language evaluation set of emotional and ontological features). This method takes into account both semantic indicators (emotional factors and ontological features) and statistical indicators (review length), considers comprehensive information in the review text and has better domain adaptability. First, an intuitive language evaluation set that considers emotional and ontological features was constructed based on statistical rules. Second, a quantitative calculation method that includes an index weight value based on the logit regression model was designed, and it can effectively avoid the subjectivity of the manual assignment method. Finally, based on the degree of membership deviation, the score function and the exact function were designed to realize a ranking of the helpfulness of reviews. Through a case simulation, we show that this method can prioritize reviews that directly evaluate the product. Through a comparative analysis and parameter sensitivity analysis, the stability and scientificity of the SO-ILES TODIM method was demonstrated. This paper broadens the research scope of reviews, enriches the research method of review helpfulness ranking and provides insights for merchants or third-party platforms to manage online reviews.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040151","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51574157); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2018MG001); Qingdao Social Science Planning Project(grant numbers:QDSKL1601107); Graduate Science and Technology Innovation Project of Shandong University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:SDKDYC190230); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268955","Ranking;helpfulness;online reviews;TODIM","Indexes;Semantics;Ontologies;Linguistics;Entropy;Decision making","","8","","40","CCBY","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an efficient identity-based fuzzy message detection method based on a novel identity-based online/offline encryption scheme. All heavy cost computation operations are carried out in the offline phase without the knowledge of the identities for each message, and the single flag ciphertext can be generated quickly with the message’s identities since only light cost computations are required in the online phase. We apply our scheme to the blockchain-based fuzzy message detection systems. Additionally, we design a new history indexing scheme based on Dodis’ verifiable random function and Schnorr’s signature. The transactions history and order of accessing storage cloud (storing and detecting messages) are indexed, and signed by each client.

In contemporary network security, TCAM-based search engines are widely used in regular expression matching across multiple packets to protect against attacks, such as by viruses and spam. However, the use of PE results in increased energy consumption for pattern updates and search operations. Instead of using PEs to determine the match, our solution is a three-phase search operation that utilizes the length information of the matched patterns to decide the longest pattern match data. This paper proposes a promising memory technology called priority-decision in memory (PDM), which eliminates the need for PEs and removes restrictions on ordering, implying that patterns can be stored in an arbitrary order without sorting their lengths. Moreover, we present a sequential input-state (SIS) scheme to disable the mass of redundant search operations in state segments on the basis of an analysis distribution of hex signatures in a virus database. Experimental results demonstrate that the PDM-based technology can improve update energy consumption of nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM) search engines by 36%-67%, because most of the energy in these search engines is used to reorder.

These techniques are utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of EGCrypto, enhancing its effectiveness and efficiency. The confidential IoT data is encrypted using low-complexity elliptic Galois cryptography. Following encryption, the encrypted data is embedded or hidden into cover blocks of an image, which are selected using the optimization algorithm. This ensures secure data communication in IoT architectures, as the encrypted data is transferred safely and can be easily recovered and decrypted at the receiving end. The experimental results demonstrate that EGCrypto outperforms competitive models with improvements of 1.8473% in peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), 1.5490% in strutural similarity index metric (SSIM), 1.7682% in normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), 1.3829% in carrier capacity, and 1.9372% in embedding efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3305271","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2023-2021-0-00118); Development of decentralized consensus composition technology for large-scale nodes); MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center)(grant numbers:IITP-2023-2021-0-01835); IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation); Researchers Supporting Project(grant numbers:RSP2023R395); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216985","Data security;the Internet of Things;secure communication;cryptography;steganography;elliptic Galois;differential evolution;hyperparameters;encryption","Cryptography;Internet of Things;Encryption;Steganography;Security;Elliptic curve cryptography;Data models;Data security;Galois fields;Hyperparameter optimization","","18","","33","CCBYNCND","14 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wireless body area network (WBAN) is one of the basic building blocks of IoT-based healthcare system, comprising many wearable (on-body) and implant (in-body) sensors placed in or around patient body connected to a hub for physiological signal monitoring. In in-body sensor-based WBAN, guaranteeing quality-of-service and prolonging network lifetime are major impediments due to the sensor location and limited battery capacity. In this article, we propose a novel energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol for IEEE 802.15.6 standard complaint in-body sensor-based WBAN. Typically, the in-body sensor-based WBAN communication is hub-initiated; however, in case of an emergency event, the in-body sensor node transmits an emergency frame arbitrarily without sensing the channel. This inadvertent in-body sensor-initiated transmission has a very high probability of collision with the ongoing hub-initiated transmission, and/or another in-body sensor-initiated emergency frame transmission. This results in emergency frame retransmission and consequently affects the node's energy consumption and lifetime. To alleviate this issue, we propose a modified superframe structure, in which separate access phases are introduced for the emergency event and regular event. In case of an emergency event, a novel emergency event handling scheme and a ranking and priority assignment protocol is proposed to detect and address the critical event of in-body sensors. To minimize the collision, a scheduled access mechanism is proposed according to the criticality of the node. Performance analysis of the proposed in-body sensor MAC is done in terms of latency and overall power consumption, in case of both emergency and regular events.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.3020306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195889","Delay;emergency event;healthcare;implant sensor;medium access control (MAC);power consumption;wireless body area network (WBAN)","Implants;Wireless communication;Resource management;Body area networks;Media Access Protocol;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Wireless sensor networks","","34","","20","IEEE","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

PML is more challenging compared to traditional multi-label learning, because PML needs not only to perform the multi classification task, but also to reduce the impact of noise information on the model. Existing PML methods suffer from the following problems. (1) Only single source of noise is considered. (2) Some methods ignore the label correlations. To solve the above problems, we proposes a new dual noise elimination and dynamic label correlation guided partial multi-label learning (PML-DNDC). Specifically, the hidden ground-truth label matrix is decomposed into two compressed matrices of instance and classifier, which are used to approximate the candidate label matrix, to eliminate the negative effects of label noise on the model. On one hand, the compressed instance matrix maintains local structural consistency with the original instances, eliminating noise in the feature. On the other hand, dynamic label correlation guidance is designed to help classifier training by dynamically exploring the potential label correlations, which encourages relevant labels to obtain similar classifiers.

To address the problem, a novel diversity-aware graph-based QoS prediction model—DSSN (Diversified Service Selection Network) is proposed in this work. DSSN alleviates selection redundancy through enhancing the selection diversity besides QoS prediction accuracy. To improve the model performance, techniques like high-order message propagation and multi-task structure are integrated into the graph based neural network model. And to enhance the service diversity, a service distance based attention mechanism is designed to embed the users in the model, so that users are connected to services with diverse attributes. We evaluate DSSN on a public dataset via extensive comparison experiments with both diversity-aware and non-diversified service selection models. In the comparison experiments, the DSSN: 1) clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art diversity-aware models in both accuracy and diversity; 2) achieves concrete diversity improvement at the cost of an acceptable decrease in the QoS prediction compared to non-diversified baselines.

Then, we formulate the EE maximization problem in the single-device IoT-DAS with imperfect CSI, and it has a special form of the difference of concave functions. To solve this problem, we develop a near-optimal power allocation (PA) scheme by using the concave–convex procedure (CCCP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method. It can achieve an EE performance similar to that of the optimal exhaustive search scheme, but with lower complexity. Based on this result, we present a suboptimal PA scheme with a single-layer iteration to decrease the complexity and maintain a performance similar to that of the near-optimal scheme. Using the results above, the EE optimization for IoT-DAS with imperfect CSI for multiple devices is addressed. A near-optimal PA scheme based on the fractional programming (FP) theory as well as the CCCP and BCD methods for solving the optimization problem is presented. Also, a suboptimal PA scheme based on the FP theory and BCD method is developed to further decrease the complexity. Interestingly, these two schemes have the same performance for perfect CSI.

With the advent of IoT, XML technologies can play an important role in addressing the issue of processing a massive amount of data generated from heterogeneous devices. As the number and complexity of such datasets increases there is a need for algorithms which are able to index and retrieve XML data efficiently even for complex queries. In this context twig pattern matching, finding all occurrences of a twig pattern query (TPQ), is a core operation in XML query processing. Until now holistic joins have been considered the state-of-the-art TPQ processing algorithms, but they fail to guarantee an optimal evaluation except at the expense of excessive storage costs which limit their scope in large datasets. In this article, we introduce a new approach which significantly outperforms earlier methods in terms of both the size of the intermediate storage and query running time. The approach presented here uses Child Prime Labels (Alsubai & North, 2018) to improve the filtering phase of bottom-up twig matching algorithms and a novel algorithm which avoids the use of stacks, thus improving TPQs processing efficiency. Several experiments were conducted on common benchmarks such as DBLP, XMark and TreeBank datasets to study the performance of the new approach. Multiple analyses on a range of twig pattern queries are presented to demonstrate the statistical significance of the improvements.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9235310","XML;holistic joins;XML databases;structural XML query processing","XML;Labeling;Pattern matching;Query processing;Indexing","","","","51","CCBY","22 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To combat this issue, we are motivated to investigate in details the optimal placement of cloudlets to minimize the average access delay by applying software-defined networking (SDN) techniques to provide flexible and programmable management for cloudlets deployment in IoT networks with considering the complicated queuing process at numerous SDN-based APs. An enumerationbased optimal placement algorithm (EOPA) is first proposed as benchmark. Then we propose a ranking-based near-optimal placement algorithm (RNOPA) which is able to dynamically adapt to mobile IoT devices and their traffic loads, by treating each AP as a single server queue and adopting an efficient ranking mechanism. As corroborated by extensive simulation results, RNOPA reports access delay very close to that of EOPA.

In the IATLR protocol, the transfer probability of the ant colony optimization (ACO) is optimized by comprehensively considering multiple factors such as energy consumption, propagation distance, and forwarding angle. Moreover, the ACO is improved and the optimized ACO is combined with the TOPSIS method by using the pheromone concentration of ACO as the decision basis of TOPSIS. Furthermore, the multifactor decision ranking of the TOPSIS method is optimized by the transfer probability of the ACO. Consequently, the best next-hop node is determined. In addition, the energy consumption is balanced through the whole network by the node silence mechanism in the IATLR protocol.

These devices can extend their battery lifespan by intelligently offloading computations as tasks to fog nodes (FNs) in their vicinity. However, finding an optimal offloading plan in a densely connected IoT-fog network is proven to be NP-Hard. Hence, in this article, we propose a matching theory-based efficient task offloading strategy called METO that aims to reduce the total system energy and number of outages (number of tasks exceeding the deadline) in an IoT-fog interconnection network. As resource allocation involves multiple criteria, their weights are derived using criteria importance though inter criteria correlation (CRITIC). Furthermore, to rank the alternatives we use the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Based on this ranking, we formulate the overall offloading problem as a one-to-many matching game and utilize the deferred acceptance algorithm (DAA) to produce a stable assignment. Simulation is performed in two different settings comprising offloading of homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks. Extensive simulations across both environments confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing schemes with respect to improved energy consumption, completion time, and execution time.

As a result, if without any effective countermeasures, outdated copies are inevitably stored by CCN routers and then distributed to the associated consumers, degrading both caching efficiency and user experience. In fact, most of related policies take little account of information freshness for cached contents, and how to tackle transient IoT data in CCN is still an ignored but crucial issue required for further explorations. Therefore, in this article, we propose an efficient popularity-based cache consistency management scheme, which aims to guarantee freshness of IoT data returned by on-path routers and avoid heavy signalling costs introduced at the same time. Extensive simulations were performed under both real-world scare-free and binary-tree topologies, and corresponding results have proved the efficiency of the proposed scheme in timely evictions of outdated IoT data stored by CCN in-network caching.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163776","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0701604); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802014); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020JBM013); Open Research Projects of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2022QA0AB06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745564","Cache consistency management;content-centric networking (CCN);named data networking (NDN);transient Internet of Things (IoT) data","Transient analysis;Internet of Things;Servers;Topology;Data models;Costs;User experience","","30","","28","IEEE","31 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, searching for real-world entities with a certain state is a challenging problem.

However, the openness, dynamics, and heterogeneity of city IoT increase the risk of attacks, especially the social attributes contained in such systems accelerate virus propagation. To reduce the risk and harm of virus propagation, it is of great significance to analyze the mode and the characteristics of virus propagation. This article proposes a dynamic virus propagation model [i.e., Ignorant-DKs- HN-Exposed-Pvirus-Spread-Recover (IDEPSR)], which focuses on two social attributes (i.e., intelligent device's propagation capability and identification ability). First, this article presents a new algorithm (i.e., DKs-HN) to measure the first attribute based on the evidence theory and an improved K-shell method. The DKs- HN merges the direct influence of a particular node and the indirect influence of 1-hop neighbors by utilizing the combination rules of the evidence theory. Second, this article proposes a Pvirus method to measure the second attribute based on the social hierarchy theory and the nonnegative matrix factor method. Every intelligent device can identify its trust relationship with other devices by using the Pvirus, and then the probability of virus activation lurking in devices can be predicted. Finally, a real data set is used to simulate a social-aware city IoT environment. Convincing experimental results show that the IDEPSR is more reasonable in design and good in performance.

Current state-of-art recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering methods, suffer from scalability and sparsity problems. This article proposes a clustering-based recommendation system that adopts the vector space model from information retrieval to obtain highly accurate recommendations. The proposed algorithm uses four well-known clustering techniques as k-means (KM), fuzzy c-mean (FCM), Single-Linkage (SLINK), and Self-Organizing-Maps (SOM). Various experiments and benchmarking on seven IoT rating datasets from different fields are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed recommender system.

In SIoT, social network merges with the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate information and resource sharing among devices in an improved way. Devices seek and provide information among their friends or friends-of-friends. However, the users of this fascinating paradigm meet with issues such as trust and privacy. Hence, trust assessment becomes one of the primary challenges. Existing trust assessment schemes in SIoT are mostly based on the trust of a service provider. The application of such schemes is related to the process of service discovery. However, the ability of a service to act maliciously is overlooked. Literature from related fields shows that services are also capable of acting maliciously. Inspired by that, we aim to define a trustworthiness assessment scheme that is based on trust of service. The application of this scheme is related to the process of service selection. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel proposition in SIoT. A parameter named Service Trust is proposed.

We propose a novel unique mapping between organizational structures and genome representations. Since hierarchical (i.e., tree-structured) organizations are one of the most common forms of organizations, we propose a novel method to map the phenotypic hierarchical structure space into a genome-like array representation space. This new representation opens up opportunities for evolutionary computing techniques to help IoT applications automatically generate organizational structures according to desired objective functions. Based on this mapping, we introduce the hierarchical GA which enriches standard genetic programming approaches with the hierarchical crossover operator with a repair strategy and the mutation of small perturbation operator.

In this paper, the joint optimization of computation offloading, radio resource allocation and caching placement in LEO satellite MEC networks are investigated. The problem is formulated to minimize the total delay of all ground IoT devices while ensuring the energy, computing and caching constraints. To solve this mixed-integer and non-convex problem, a Lagrange dual decomposition (LDD)-based algorithm is proposed to obtain the closed-form optimal solution.

Finally, it selects appropriate density centers from a decision graph, which merge their surrounding points into the same groups. Experiments are conducted to show that DAC has higher accuracy than six classic and updated algorithms. Its effectiveness is shown via data from photovoltaic power and oil extraction systems.

In this paper, the SIoT paradigm is applied to a scenario where geolocated sensing tasks are assigned to fixed and mobile devices, providing the following major contributions. The SIoT model is adopted to find the objects that can contribute to the IoT application by crawling the social network through the nodes profile and trust level. A new algorithm to address the resource management issue is proposed so that sensing tasks are fairly assigned to the objects in the SIoT.

Because of the large address space of the Internet and the mapping’s mutative nature, efficiently tracking the evolution of IP-device mapping with a limited budget of scans is essential for building timely cyber search engines. An intuitive solution is to use reinforcement learning to schedule more scans to networks with high churn rates of IP-device mapping. However, such an intuitive solution has never been systematically studied. In this paper, we take the first step toward demystifying this problem based on our experiences in maintaining a global IoT scanning platform. Inspired by the measurement study of large-scale real-world IoT scan records, we land reinforcement learning onto a system capable of smartly scanning IoT devices in a principled way. We disclose key parameters affecting the effectiveness of different scanning strategies, and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system can scan up to around 40 times as many IP-device mapping mutations as random/sequential scanning.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2023.3312162","National Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:61972313,62272381,62002306,62202405,T2341003); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2023-JC-JQ-50); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663725,2021T140543,2023M732791); Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) Project(grant numbers:PolyU15223918); CCF-NSFOCUS Kunpeng Research Fund of China; Cyrus Tang Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10250418","Internet of Things (IoT);adaptive algorithms;IP networks;cyberspace","Internet of Things;Search engines;IP networks;Fingerprint recognition;Cameras;Schedules;Reinforcement learning","","","","41","IEEE","13 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we investigate a previously sidelined aspect of EVCS security. We analyze the deployment security of EVCSs and highlight operator-induced vulnerabilities rendering the ecosystem exposed to remote intrusions. We create an advanced discovery technique that leverages Web interface artifacts to dynamically discover new charging station vendors. As a result, we uncover 33,320 charging station management systems in the wild. Consequently, we study the deployment security of the charging stations and identify that 28,046 EVCSs were found to be vulnerable to eavesdropping, and around 24% of the studied EVCSs are deployed with default configurations exposing the ecosystem to a Mirai-like attack vector. Aligned with this finding, we discover that the EVCS ecosystem has been targeted by nefarious IoT malware such as Mirai and its variants.

Efficient and secure slice provisioning algorithms are important since network slices share the limited resources of the physical network. In this article, we first analyze the security issues in network slicing and formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for secure 5G core network slice provisioning. Then, we propose a heuristic 5G core network slice provisioning algorithm called VIKOR-CNSP based on VIKOR, which is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. In the slice node provisioning stage, the node importance is ranked with the VIKOR approach by considering the node resource and topology attributes. The slice nodes are then provisioned according to the ranking results. In the slice link provisioning stage, the k shortest path algorithm is implemented to obtain the candidate physical paths for the slice link, and a strategy for selecting a candidate physical path is proposed to increase the slice acceptance ratio. The strategy first calculates the path factor Pf which is the product of the maximum link bandwidth utilization of the candidate physical path and its hop-count, and then chooses the candidate physical path with the smallest Pf to host the slice link. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the highest slice acceptance ratio and the largest provisioning revenue-to-cost ratio, satisfying the security constraints of 5G core network slice requests.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947454","Qatar National Research Fund(grant numbers:NPRP 8-634-1-131); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:CNS-1718929,CNS-1547380); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201506270075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869775","5G core network slice;network slicing;slice provisioning;slice security;VIKOR approach","5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Security;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Bandwidth","","30","","37","CCBY","16 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to solve this problem, this article proposes a new FMEA model, which combines hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets (HPFSs) and ORESTE method. Specifically, HPFSs are used to describe the risk assessment information of experts. The ORESTE method is extended to determine the risk priority of the failure modes in FMEA. Moreover, the PIR structure of ORESTE is improved to reduce the subjective influence of experts. Finally, an example of risk assessment of intelligent aquaculture system is given to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed FMEA model.

In this paper, we first discuss the importance of considering multiple different objectives within a learning model for recommender system. Next, to capture users' objective-level preferences by utilizing interactive information in the sequential context, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-objective Recommendation (DMORec) framework with interactive evolution for SR. In particular, DMORec formulates a dynamic multi-objective optimization task to simultaneously optimize more than two varying objectives in an interactive recommendation process. Moreover, to resolve this optimization task in SR, we develop an evolutionary algorithm with supervised learning approach to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions of the formulated problem.

Traditional VS researches mostly target at the effectiveness of the VS algorithms by introducing the high quality of features and clusters for selecting representative visual elements. Due to the increased density of vision sensors network, there is a tradeoff between the processing time of the VS methods with reasonable and representative quality of the generated summaries. It is a challenging task to generate a video summary of significant importance while fulfilling the needs of Internet of Things (IoT) surveillance networks with constrained resources. This article addresses this problem by proposing a new computationally effective solution through designing a deep CNN framework with hierarchical weighted fusion for the summarization of surveillance videos captured in IoT settings. The first stage of our framework designs discriminative rich features extracted from deep CNNs for shot segmentation. Then, we employ image memorability predicted from a fine-tuned CNN model in the framework, along with aesthetic and entropy features to maintain the interestingness and diversity of the summary. Third, a hierarchical weighted fusion mechanism is proposed to produce an aggregated score for the effective computation of the extracted features. Finally, an attention curve is constituted using the aggregated score for deciding outstanding keyframes for the final video summary.

The core idea behind recognizing activities accurately is to assist Internet-of-things (IoT) enabled smart surveillance systems. Thereby, this work is based on the joint use of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify and detect human activities accurately. Recent approaches on HAR exploit the three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial information, which adds a computational burden. In our case, features are extracted using 3D-DWT instead of 3-D CNNs, performed in three steps of 1D-DWT to reflect the spatio-temporal features of human action. Given the features, the RNN produces an output label for each video clip taking care of the long-term temporal consistency among close predictions in the output sequence. It is noticed that feature extraction through 3D-DWT essentially recovers the multiple angles of an activity. Many HAR techniques distinguish an activity based on the posture of an image frame rather than learning the transitional relationship between postures in the temporal sequence, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address this problem, in this article, we designed a novel rank-based fuzzy approach that segregates activities precisely by ranking the probabilities of activities based on confidence scores. FuzzyAct achieved an average mean average precision (mAP) of 0.8012 mAP on the ActivityNet dataset, and outperformed the baseline counterparts and other state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets.

To compare all technologies on an equal basis, we have developed an analyzer that computes the energy consumption for a given protocol based on the power required in a given state (Sleep, Idle, Tx, and Rx) and the duration of each state. We consider the case of an energy constrained node that uploads data to a sink, analyzing the physical (PHY) layer under medium access control (MAC) constraints, and assuming IPv6 traffic whenever possible. This paper considers the energy spent in retransmissions due to corrupted frames and collisions as well as the impact of imperfect clocks. The comparison shows that the BLE offers the best lifetime for all traffic intensities in its capacity range. LoRa achieves long lifetimes behind 802.15.4 and BLE for ultra low traffic intensity; SIGFOX only matches LoRa for very small data sizes. Moreover, considering the energy consumption due to retransmissions of lost data packets only decreases the lifetimes without changing their relative ranking. We believe that these comparisons will give all users of IoT technologies indications about the technology that best fits their needs from the energy consumption point of view.

This paper aims to find an efficient substrate selection approach for flexible and wearable electronic applications. A hybridized Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, namely the Analytic Hierarchy Tradeoff Ranking Technique (AH-TOR), is used to select the most suitable flexible substrate out of the several widely used options for the temperature sensor. The selection of the best substrate for the said application is made based on various properties. In this case, AHP is used to evaluate the criteria weights, while the TOR method determines the weights of alternatives. Further, different PEDOT: PSS-based temperature sensors have been fabricated to validate the optimization technique. Based on the performance of the sensors, it is found that the sensitivity of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is superior, and the sensitivity of PET is approximately 53.3% better than Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 47.4% superior to Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The result is in sync with the optimization, where PET is at the top among all other alternatives.

Lean management has been shown to be a significant element in the success of digitalization, particularly in driving and directing companies on their digital technologies implementation journey. Despite this, there is limited evidence of how Lean Management can facilitate the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies. Intending to understand this facilitating role, this article investigates the relationship between different Lean practices and the most common Industry 4.0 implementation barriers. Relying on expert opinions, through the use of the interpretive ranking process methodology, a specific relationship between Lean practices and barriers has been depicted, showing that some practices have a major impact in reducing some specific barriers. In particular, the ones related to the elimination of waste and continuous improvement bundle are expected to be the most prominent.

Current proposals would refer to either keyword or spatial location, then the matched sensor data should be manually selected by requesters. However, the selection is arduous as there are massive connected devices. To this end, we propose a combinatorial-oriented feedback (COF) mechanism to guarantee the reliability and accessibility of feedback results via enabling an intuitive exhibition of aggregated sensor data. Two critical issues are addressed in this article: 1) sensor data combination and 2) aggregated results ranking. To facilitate the combination process, we first propose two decisive factors for aggregated result evaluation. The multiple sensor-data combinatorial (MSC) problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization model. To balance the tradeoff between competing quality metrics, we introduce Pareto sensor set (PSS) as an optimal solution for MSC problem, and devise the elitist directive breeding (EDB) method to get PSS solutions. In order to speed up the search efficiency and improve the feedback recall, we then develop the fast EDB (FEDB) algorithm, which is able to return top- ${k}$  ranked results according to different searching requirements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COF mechanism, we conduct extensive simulations based on a virtual mobile sensing scenario. The results show that our proposed COF mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions significantly in terms of search efficiency and feedback quality, and specially, FEDB responds quite faster than EDB under the command of top- ${k}$  ranking.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2944660","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571334); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2019CFB765); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854239","Internet of Things (IoT)-based search;multiobjective optimization;search feedback;sensor data combination","Internet of Things;Sensors;Optimization;Wireless sensor networks;Measurement;Data models","","11","","40","IEEE","1 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are single point of failure and data leakage problems in the current industrial Internet data sharing and storage process due to the adoption of single-cloud storage mode. This paper proposes a multi-cloud collaborative data security sharing scheme with blockchain indexing. The blockchain-assisted multi-cloud storage model is constructed to enable indirect retrieval of industrial data through a federation chain. Enterprises on the alliance chain cannot directly access the industrial data stored in their respective private clouds for each other. To address the lack of trustworthiness of ciphertext retrieval, a tree-structured indexing method supporting keyword ciphertext retrieval is designed to realize efficient keyword token search. To prevent unfair trading behavior of data sharing participants, a fair trading contract is designed to overcome the disadvantage of dishonest execution of protocols by cloud servers. The security analysis shows that the scheme satisfies IND-CKA security. Simulation results show that the tree indexing approach constructed in this paper has less time overhead compared to the traditional sequential indexing and other robust technique. And the efficiency advantage is more prominent when the number of keywords is huge.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2024.3398774","Jingyu Feng(grant numbers:2024GX-YBXM-076,62102312); Wenbo Zhang(grant numbers:No. 2023-JC-YB-561); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10527361","Industrial Internet;Multi-Cloud Collaboration;Blockchain Index;Data Security Sharing","Encryption;Cryptography;Blockchains;Cloud computing;Servers;Security;Data models","","","","","IEEE","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The vector space model (VSM) represents documents as high-dimensional vectors, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term. While originally proposed for information retrieval systems, VSM has also seen wide applications in patent analytics and is used as a fundamental tool to map patent documents to structured data. However, the VSM method suffers from several limitations when applied to patent analysis tasks, such as loss of sentence-level semantics and curse-of-dimensionality problems. In order to address the above limitations, we propose patent analytics based on feature VSM (FVSM), where the FVSM is constructed by mapping patent documents to feature the vectors extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The applications of FVSM for three typical patent analysis tasks, i.e., patents similarity comparison, patent clustering, and patent map generation, are discussed. A case study using patents related to the Internet of Things (IoT) technology is illustrated to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of FVSM. The proposed FVSM can be adopted by other patent analysis studies to replace VSM, based on which various big data learning tasks can be performed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909123","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671089); Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:XTCX201828); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681129","CNN;IoT;patent analysis;VSM","Patents;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Semantics;Big Data;Analytical models;Technological innovation","","29","1","30","OAPA","3 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, an approach for web service selection based on QoS parameters is proposed. The proposed method starts with prefiltering of candidate web services using classification technique.

Sharing economy, i.e., a peer-to-peer-based sharing of access to assets, can help reduce the total resources required and consequently reduce carbon footprints. In line with this objective, we propose an intelligent model to study carbon dioxide emissions from road transport using taxi trips in Dublin, Ireland. The proposed method is a hybrid unsupervised learning approach tailored for the particular structure of the problem. We present how an intelligent approach can be implemented to model CO2 emissions from road transport. The model categorizes taxis based on different features related to the emissions they release. Five clusters are detected, which can be attributed to varying levels of emissions. Accordingly, those vehicles labeled as the highest emitters can be targeted for further improvements in reducing CO2, i.e., replacing pollutant cars with electric cars or including them in the taxi fleet as sharing ones only.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3096279","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:16/IA/4610); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481118","Artificial intelligence;CO2 reduction;energy consumption;sharing economy","Public transportation;Automobiles;Carbon dioxide;Fuels;Economics;Roads;Unsupervised learning","","23","","34","CCBY","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ICedge runs on top of named-data networking, a realization of the information-centric networking vision, and handles the “low-level” network communication on behalf of applications. ICedge features a fully distributed design that: 1) enables users to get seamlessly on-boarded onto an edge network; 2) delivers application invoked tasks to edge nodes for execution in a timely manner; and 3) offers naming abstractions and network-based mechanisms to enable (partial or full) reuse of the results of already executed tasks among users, which we call “compute reuse,” resulting in lower task completion times and efficient use of edge computing resources.

Advanced wearable acceleration sensors based on socially implemented Internet of medical things (IoMT) devices can remotely provide a platform for recognizing FOG. However, due to the diverse data acquisition modes that appear in classic IoMT devices, the obtained data may contain imprecise, hesitant, and incomplete ones. Meanwhile, the bounded rationality owned by neurologists usually has a big impact on using wearable acceleration sensors to predict illnesses. Therefore, the objective of this article lies in exploring a fuzzy intelligence learning approach based on bounded rationality in IoMT systems and providing a valid scheme for biomedical data analysis. Specifically, a brand-new three-way group decision-making approach by means of TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive multicriteria decision-making) with incomplete dual hesitant fuzzy (DHF) information and its applications in detecting FOG in PD using IoMT devices are systematically explored. First, taking advantage of DHF sets (DHFSs) when depicting realistic group decision information, the concept of multigranulation (MG) incomplete DHF information systems is built. Second, adjustable MG DHF probabilistic rough sets (PRSs) are further put forward via DHF similarity relations. Third, a three-way group decision-making approach is constructed by virtue of adjustable MG DHF PRSs and TODIM. Finally, the validity, effectiveness, and practicality of the constructed three-way group decision-making approach are investigated by a University of California, Irvine (UCI) dataset with several experimental analyses in the background of FOG detection in PD using IoMT devices. The experimental result indicates that the developed fuzzy intelligence learning approach achieves reasonable diagnostic conclusions for FOG detection in PD from the perspective of uncertain information processing abilities, decision risks, and bounded rationality.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3221933","NSFC(grant numbers:62272284,62072294,12271146,61972238,61806116); Special Fund for Science and Technology Innovation Teams of Shanxi Province; Graduate Education Innovation Programs of Shanxi Province(grant numbers:2021Y147,2021YJJG041); Research Project Supported by Shanxi Scholarship Council of China(grant numbers:2022-007); Training Program for Young Scientific Researchers of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi; Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:201903D421041); Cultivate Scientific Research Excellence Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi(grant numbers:2019SK036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9968192","Bounded rationality;fuzzy intelligence learning;Internet of medical things (IoMT) devices;Parkinson’s disease (PD);three-way decision (3WD)","Decision making;Medical diagnostic imaging;Task analysis;Rough sets;Diseases;Training;Legged locomotion","","37","","46","IEEE","1 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model integrates Bayesian Network (BN) and software trustworthy computing approach. BN is used to calculate the risk value of attributes that describe the fire risk situation of the intelligent building from 7 profiles. Based on the fire risk attribute values, trustworthy computing is adopted to classify the fire risk into 5 ranks which indicates the severity degree of building fire risk: the higher the rank is, the greater the harm is. Taking the Shanghai Jing’an 11.15 fire as an example, the result confirms that the method proposed in this paper has good theoretical significance and practical value. In addition, we compare our method with 3 fire risk assessment methods in the reference. The comparisons illustrate that the trustworthy classification model proposed in this paper is more comprehensive, rational, and scientific.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3143614","National Key Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2018YFB2101300); Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center for Trusted Industry Internet Software; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682751","Intelligent building;fire risk assessment;fire risk trustworthy classification model;Bayesian network;trustworthy computing","Buildings;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Bayes methods;Risk management;Real-time systems;Measurement","","1","","44","CCBYNCND","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Primarily, RPL can support a dynamic range of mobility among the nodes in the network, which becomes a great demand now for real-time applications. At the same time, RPL is much vulnerable to various security attacks because of its resource-constrained nature. Such security attacks might cause severe threats and destructive behavior inside the network. In this article, we primarily focus on the Sybil attack, where an attacker claims multiple illegitimate identities either by fabricating or compromising the nodes. Also, in this type of attack, a single adversary is required to control multiple legitimate nodes in the network, and thereby, the adversary node saves the physical resources. In this article, we propose a novel artificial bee colony (ABC)-inspired mobile Sybil attack modeling and lightweight intrusion detection algorithm for the Sybil attack in mobile RPL. Moreover, we considered three different categories of Sybil attack based on its behavior, and we analyze the performance of the RPL under the Sybil attack in terms of packet delivery ratio, control traffic overhead, and energy consumption. Also, we examine the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2948149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8876683","Accuracy;Internet of Things (IoT);intrusion detection;lightweight security;mobility;RPL;Sybil attack","Internet of Things;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Topology;Routing;Mathematical model","","84","","15","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our experimental results show that the classification performance by the proposed method is superior to those of the other methods by up to 21.8%. Moreover, our method provides security to other users' data sets, as the method utilizes only mean values from imposter data.

The proposed credibility, interest and sentiment enhanced recommendation (CISER) model has five modules namely candidate feature extraction, reviewer credibility analysis, user interest mining, candidate feature sentiment assignment and recommendation module. Review corpus is given as an input to the CISER model. Candidate feature extraction module uses context and sentiment confidence to extract features of importance. To make our model robust to fake and unworthy reviews and reviewers, reviewer credibility analysis proffers an approach of associating expertise, trust and influence scores with reviewers to weigh their opinion according to their credibility. The user interest mining module uses aesthetics of review writing as heuristics for interest-pattern mining. The candidate feature sentiment assignment module scores candidate features present in review based on their fastText sentiment polarity. Finally, the recommendation module uses credibility weighted sentiment scoring of user preferred features for purchase recommendations. The proposed recommendation methodology harnesses not only numeric ratings, but also sentiment expressions associated with features, customer preference profile and reviewer credibility for quantitative analysis of various alternative products.

DI-FAM successively stacks the short rule bundles of each FAM subclassifier on both a sampled feature subset and the outputs of the previous stacking layer. DI-FAM then finds out the output weights of short rule bundles at each stacking layer, followed by a linear subclassifier (as a compensator) on all the original input features with one-step wide calculation.

ReID recognizes pedestrians across camera views at different locations and time, which is usually treated as a ranking task. An essential part of this task is the hard sample mining. Technically, two strategies could be employed, i.e., global hard mining and local hard mining. For the former, hard samples are mined within the entire training set, while for the latter, it is done in mini-batches. In literature, most existing methods operate locally. Examples include batch-hard sample mining and semihard sample mining. The reason for the rare use of global hard mining is the high computational complexity. In this article, we argue that global mining helps to find harder samples that benefit model training. To this end, this article introduces a new system to: 1) efficiently mine hard samples (positive and negative) from the entire training set and 2) effectively use them in training. Specifically, a ranking list network coupled with a multiplet loss is proposed. On the one hand, the multiplet loss makes the ranking list progressively created to avoid the time-consuming initialization. On the other hand, the multiplet loss aims to make effective use of the hard and easy samples during training.

AMI consists of smart electric, gas, and water meters, and the devices are very limited in terms of battery, processing power, and memory. The deployment and operational needs of energy-constrained network infrastructures in smart water and gas metering systems require the use of routing mechanisms that consider energy consumption, minimize energy use, and prolong network lifetime. An efficient routing metric is needed for energy-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose an energy- and congestion-aware routing metric for smart meter networks to be deployed in smart cities. The proposed metric is an adaptive parent node selection mechanism that considers the residual energy and queue utilization of neighboring nodes. Minimizing power consumption will enhance network lifetime. The proposed scheme was evaluated with the Cooja Simulator 3.0 using random and grid topology.

The loss of connectivity often leads to degrade performance and inability to fulfill the application mission. To address this issue, several proposals have been made in the literature where node mobility is exploited to re-establish connectivity. These proposals, however, focus on minimizing the number of mobile nodes and the traveled distance cost while ignoring important factors, such as robot battery level, network lifetime, and environmental conditions, that may limit or hinder the whole recovery process. To overcome these limitations, we present a distributed node repositioning algorithm based on fuzzy logic.

First, using publicly available data, we show that informational networks not only satisfy well-known principles such as the small-world property and variants of the power law degree distribution, but that they also exhibit the geometric property of large-scale negative curvature, also referred to as hyperbolicity. We then provide examples of large-scale physical networks that universally lack this property, thus showing that hyperbolicity is not an ever-present feature of real-life networks in general. We document how hyperbolicity leads to unusually high centrality in informational networks. We then describe an approximation of hyperbolic networks that leverages the observed property of high centrality. We provide evidence that the fidelity of the proposed approximation is not only high for applications such as distance approximation, but that it can speed computation by a factor of 1000X or more. Finally, we discuss two applications of our proposed linear-time distance approximation for informational networks: one for personalized ranking and the other for clustering. These and many more algorithms yet to be developed take full advantage of our proposed tree-approximation of hyperbolic networks and further demonstrate its power and utility.","1538-7305","","10.15325/BLTJ.2015.2437465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7137721","","Big data;Research and development;Large-scale systems;Dynamic networks;Approximation algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information systems;Ranking methods","","1","","21","Alcatel-Lucent","26 Jun 2015","","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

The IoT industry decision making is critically important for countries or societies to enhance the effectiveness and validity of leadership, which can greatly accelerate the industrialized and large-scale development. In the case of IoT industry decision evaluation, the essential problem arises serious incompleteness, impreciseness, subjectivity, and incertitude. Interval neutrosophic set, disposing of the indeterminacy portrayed by truth membership T, indeterminacy membership I, and falsity membership F with interval form, is a more viable and effective means to seize indeterminacy. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the multiparametric distance measure and similarity measure. Meanwhile, some interesting properties of distance measure and similarity measure are proved. Then, the objective weights of diverse attributes are ascertained by the deviation-based method. Moreover, we explore the combination weight, which reveals both the objective preference and subjective preference. The validity of the algorithm is illustrated by an IoT industry decision-making issue, along with the effect of diverse parameters on the ranking.

A novel pruning method, termed CLR-RNF, is proposed. We first reveal a “long-tail” pruning problem in magnitude-based weight pruning methods and then propose a computation-aware measurement for individual weight importance, followed by a cross-layer ranking (CLR) of weights to identify and remove the bottom-ranked weights. Consequently, the per-layer sparsity makes up the pruned network structure in our filter pruning. Then, we introduce a recommendation-based filter selection scheme where each filter recommends a group of its closest filters. To pick the preserved filters from these recommended groups, we further devise a  ${k}$ -reciprocal nearest filter (RNF) selection scheme where the selected filters fall into the intersection of these recommended groups. Both our pruned network structure and the filter selection are nonlearning processes, which, thus, significantly reduces the pruning complexity and differentiates our method from existing works. We conduct image classification on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet to demonstrate the superiority of our CLR-RNF over the state-of-the-arts. For example, on CIFAR-10, CLR-RNF removes 74.1% FLOPs and 95.0% parameters from VGGNet-16 with even 0.3% accuracy improvements. On ImageNet, it removes 70.2% FLOPs and 64.8% parameters from ResNet-50 with only 1.7% top-five accuracy drops.

The successful distillation pulls up the distilling model accuracy. In the context of model compression, the teacher model provides softened labels that facilitate distillation. While some effort has been devoted to progressive training, and a majority of the effort in literature has been in teacher-student distillation configuration or methodologies, less effort has been spent in non-progressive training, meta-learning controlled distillation, and progressive training with algorithm-controlled target distribution. In this paper, we proposed a framework of Teacher-Free Knowledge Distillation (TFKD) based on non-progressive meta-learned Reinforcement Learning (RL) method. The student model learns from free-form distribution, which will change during training. In this scenario, the target distribution is varied during the training epochs, and the variation is not necessarily continuously merging toward the true distribution. Due to the algorithm-controlled nature of the target distribution variation during KD, the meta-learning KD is established.

The knowledge of influential spreaders in complex networks is extremely useful for controlling the spread of information. Centrality measures are known for effectively quantifying the influential nodes information in large-scale complex networks. Researchers have proposed different centrality measures in the literature, including Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, and Clustering coefficient centralities. However, these measures have certain limitations when implemented over large-scale complex networks. Most of these measures can be classified as global and local structural approaches. The global structure based algorithms are too complex to evaluate key nodes, particularly in large-scale networks, whereas the local measures overlook the essential global network information. To address these challenges, an extended clustering coefficient local global centrality (ECLGC) is proposed, which combines the local and global structural information to measure the node’s influence in large-scale networks. The effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed measure are compared with existing centrality measures on real-world network datasets. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is utilized to evaluate the performance of the ECLGC to capture the high-information dissemination compared to conventional measures.

The computation at its core is low-precision linear algebra. Thus, ML is both broad enough to apply to many domains and narrow enough to benefit from domain-specific architectures, such as Googles Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Moreover, the growth in demand for ML computing exceeds Moores law at its peak, just as it is fading.

As a special group of humans, cross-dressers are often very sensitive to their non-mainstream identities. Therefore, they are often confronted with more difficulties when using some modern information techniques such as Content-of-Interest (COI) search. Motivated by this fact, we introduce some advanced information retrieval and privacy protection techniques into the cross-dressing domain and further propose a privacy-aware COI search and recommendation solution for cross-dressers, named PCSR. First, PCSR uses fastText tool to transform the cross-dressers’ input keywords and the candidate webpages into corresponding vectors with less private content associated with cross-dressers. Afterwards, we use vector similarity calculation techniques to make privacy-preserving COI search and recommendation. At last, we validate the effectiveness of PCSR through a set of experiments.

With the rapid increase of massive business process-related data under Industry 4.0, effectively retrieval of process models from large process model repositories becomes a critical challenge for process mining, process deployment and process model acquisition. To accelerate the retrieval of process models from a large process repository, existing retrieval methods rely solely on building single dimension process model indices. In this article we show that this single dimension indexing approach is not only inefficient but also cumbersome for supporting high performance retrieval services over large process model repositories. We propose a new business process model indexing and retrieval with structure and behavior fusion. In the indexing stage, we propose a process model index generation paradigm method with two novel features. First, our index algorithm can transform the trace equivalent process model (TEPM) with complex structures into a process tree, which can better capture process sequence semantics than the existing approach based on block structured process model. Second, we improve the method for computing the process tree edit distance for measuring process model similarity by introducing the process tree similarity method, which can distinguish leaf nodes and non-leaf nodes and improve the limitations of the traditional edit distance algorithm. Extensive experiments using real world process repositories demonstrate that the proposed methods are under polynomial time in both the model index generation and model querying stages, and offer superior retrieval performance compared to existing process model retrieval methods in terms of efficiency, search capability and scope.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2023.3348294","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62362067,62002310); Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation Fundamental Research(grant numbers:202101AT070004); Science Foundation of Yunnan Jinzhi Expert Workstation(grant numbers:202205AF150006); Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering Open Fund Project(grant numbers:2023SE205); Yunnan Xing Dian Talents Support Plan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10376316","Business process model;complete finite prefix unfolding;Industry 4.0;process model repository;process retrieval","Business;Behavioral sciences;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Computational modeling;Data models;Analytical models;Indexing","","","","74","IEEE","29 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent advances in IoT hardware, e.g., networks of heterogeneous embedded devices, and software, e.g., lightweight computer vision algorithms and cloud optimization solutions, make it possible to efficiently process data from diverse sources in a connected (smart) farm. By interconnecting these IoT devices, often across large geographical distances, it is possible to collect data at different time scales, including in near real-time (i.e., with delays of only a few tens of seconds). This data can then be used for actionable insights, e.g., precise applications of soil supplements and reduced environmental footprint. Through LATTICE, we present an integrated vision for IoT solutions, data processing, and actionable analytics for digital agriculture. We couple this with discussion of economics and policy considerations that will underlie adoption of such IoT and ML technologies.

This paper proposes a QoS-aware clustering-based routing (QACR) mechanism for LLNs in Fog-enabled IoT which provides a clustering, a cluster head (CH) election, and a routing path selection technique. The clustering adopts the community detection algorithm that partitions the network into clusters with available nodes’ connectivity. The CH election and relay node selection both are weighted by the rank of the nodes which take node’s energy, received signal strength, link quality, and number of cluster members into consideration as the ranking metrics. The number of CHs in a cluster is adaptive and varied according to a cluster state to balance the energy consumption of nodes. Besides, the protocol uses the CH role handover technique during CH election that decreases the control messages for the periodic election and cluster formation in detail. An evaluation of the QACR has performed through simulations for various scenarios. The obtained results show that the QACR improves the QoS in terms of packet delivery ratio, latency, and network lifetime compared to the existing protocols.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2019.2946428","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology(grant numbers:2016R1A2B4013002); Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:2018-0-00508); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8863927","Internet of Things;fog computing;low power and lossy network;clustering;routing;quality of service","Protocols;Voting;Routing;Relays;Internet of Things;Quality of service;Energy consumption","","14","","48","CCBY","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a general information filtering technology, the recommender systems can help to associate information with each other in the IoT and to recommend personalized services for users. However, in practical applications, the collected data is uncertain due to noise, sensor errors, transmission errors, etc., which in turn affects system performance. In order to solve the data uncertainty problem in the IoT-based recommender systems, we propose a new recommender framework with item dithering. In this framework, the list of recommendations generated by the recommender algorithm is stored in a newly opened storage space for the entire session of the interaction between the user and the system. When the user interacts with the system, the list is pushed to the user after being shaken. Based on the proposed framework, we designed IDither, an item-based dithering and recommendation algorithm to shake out irrelevant items through predetermined indicators, thereby retaining the items required by the user and recommending them to the user. Experiment evaluations on real datasets show that IDither is an effective solution for handling uncertainty in the IoT-based recommender systems.

The techniques are illustrated via worked examples that have been deployed live on geospatial data from the transportation domain. This draws upon a real-world case study in intelligent transportation looking at on-demand, real-time predictions of flows of train movements across the UK rail network. Evaluation of the proposed techniques shows the response time, for varying volumes of queries involving prediction, to remain almost constant (at 50 ms), even as the database scales up to the 250M entries. The query response time is important in this context as the target is predicting train delays. It is even more important in a serverless environment due to the stringent constraints on serverless functions' runtime before timeout.

Network embedding techniques can potentially aid effective resource discovery services in edge environments, by achieving a proximity-preserving representation of the network resources. Most of the existing techniques of network embedding fail to capture accurate proximity information among the network nodes and further lack exploiting information beyond the second-order neighbourhood. This paper leverages artificial intelligence for network representation and proposes a deep learning model, named inductive content augmented network embedding (ICANE), which integrates the network structure and resource content attributes into a feature vector. Secondly, a hierarchical aggregation approach is introduced to explicitly learn the network representation through sampling the nodes and aggregating features from the higher-order neighbourhood. A semantic proximity search model is then designed to generate the top-k ranking of relevant nodes using the learned network representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the existing popular methods in terms of resource discovery and the query resolving performance.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2902877","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20170069); UK–Jiangsu 20-20 World-Class University Initiative; UK–Jiangsu 20-20 Initiative Pump Priming; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658146","Artificial intelligence (AI);deep learning;edge computing;network embedding;resource discovery","Computational modeling;Informatics;Edge computing;Semantics;Deep learning;Mathematics;Task analysis","","14","","35","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, edge computing servers have to be introduced to locally store and analyze growing time-series data. Unfortunately, conventional time-series databases exhibit low efficiency on edge nodes with limited resources for both computation and storage. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient time-series database, called EdgeDB, to fully utilize the capacity of the edge nodes. EdgeDB effectively improves the performances of both inserting and retrieving data from ingest streams by efficiently merging multiple streams and optimizing the storage data structure concurrently. EdgeDB first compactly organizes multiple online streams into a tablet within a time window and embeds predefined aggregate query results together. EdgeDB adopts Time Partitioned Elastic Index (TPEI) to build indexing on all tablets, enhancing the time-range query performance while reducing the memory usage by optimizing the indexing storage. EdgeDB further develops Time Merged Tree (TMTree) to combine a set of tablets into a large one, significantly boosting the write throughput and potentially strengthening the performance of inter-tablet query. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show that, compared with the state-of-the-art time-series database BTrDB, EdgeDB achieves performance improvements of up to 2.2× in insert throughput, 3.6× in write throughput, and 67% in query latency with lower memory consumption.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2943876","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61821003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872156); Huazhong University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:Grant2018YFA0701804); Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:2018KFYXKJC037); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1704504,CCF-1629625); Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research (AIR) Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8850107","Time-series database;edge computing;time partitioned elastic index;I/O optimization","Databases;Sensors;Throughput;Edge computing;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Servers","","17","","35","CCBY","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Slice isolation is a mechanism for protecting the slices against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To overcome these two challenges, we have proposed a novel actor-critic Reinforcement Learning (RL) model, called Slice Isolation-based Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), using five optimal graph features to create the problem environment, the form of which is changed based on a ranking scheme. The ranking procedure reduces the dimension of the features and improves learning performance. We evaluated SIRL by comparing it against four non-RL and nine state-of-the-art RL models. The average results show that the ratio of the covered requests and the damage caused by a DDoS attack of SIRL is 54% higher and 23% lower than that of the other models, respectively.

Whereas several studies have employed artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze NTL, a major drawback in these studies is the focus on customer data only without considering the possible contribution of electricity distribution staff to NTL. This study introduces a novel approach to NTL reduction by analyzing a combined dataset of staff operational processes and customer consumption data. A deep-learning architecture called non-technical losses convolutional neural network (NTLCONVNET) was developed which consists of a series of three one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) with different depths combined with several fully connected layers. Furthermore, limited or no research has studied the decision rationale influencing how AI models interpret the significance of features in predicting NTL. To achieve the explainability of the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) kernel and tree-based explainers were used for the deep and ensemble learning models respectively to determine the relative importance of the variables and how they contribute to the overall model prediction. A novel ranking framework was used to compute the holistic ranking of the variables across multiple models. The finding suggests that the staff-related variables omitted in the extant literature are significant predictors of NTL. The NTLCONVNET was compared with 5 ensemble learning algorithms and the results show that the NTLCONVNET significantly surpasses all other models, scoring 0.844, 0.838, 0.836 and 0.836 on weighted average Precision, Recall, f1 and accuracy respectively.

In order to realize long-term detection of ECG under the limited hardware and network resources especially in the power/computing constrained IoT scenarios, compressive sensing (CS) has attracted tremendous research efforts thanks to its high efficiency in sample collection and information retrieval. Most existing researches focus on reconstructing the original ECG signal from the received compressive samples, which however not only leads to high energy consumption but also suffers from unnecessarily huge computational complexity for full-dimensional recovery. To solve such problems, this paper aims at a task-cognizant sparse signal processing technique for retrieving the necessary information only. Specifically, a correlation-assist compression with adaptive length (CCAL) algorithm is developed, where ECG signal is compressed individually within each pseudo-period to retain the information of each separate heartbeat. In doing so, the compression length is dynamically varying, which is determined by calculating the correlation coefficients between adjacent fragments. In addition, a preprocessing filter is adopted to offset the performance loss resulted from compression. With the compressed heartbeat acquired through CCAL, we extract autoregressive (AR) coefficients directly in the compressed domain. Afterwards, an SVM classifier is used to identify the conditions of the ECG signal. Finally, real data from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is used for validating the proposed techniques that work efficiently in moderate compression ratios, while achieving desired classification accuracy as the non-compression benchmark at much reduced computational complexity.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3081577","National Natural Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433552","Adaptive length;autoregressive model;compressive sensing;ECG","Electrocardiography;Heart beat;Feature extraction;Sensors;Matching pursuit algorithms;Compressed sensing;Biomedical monitoring","","8","","40","IEEE","17 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, IoT applications need to continuous collect new data and deposit huge historical time series data, which pose a significant challenge for the static indexing approach. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight index structure, L-index, and a matching approach, L-match, for the constraint normalized subsequence matching problem (cNSM). L-index is a two-layer structure and built on the simple series synopsis, the mean values of the disjoint windows. It is easy to build and update as data grows.

It is no surprise that security concerns increase as connected IoT devices become more prevalent. There has long been a perception that Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks give rise to a notable menace to the security of smart city networks. A statistical method based on feature distance maps is suggested in this work for the identification of DoS attacks in smart city networks. This study aims to build a DoS attack detection model that has a low computational complexity and a low rate of false positives (FPs). The performance of the model is arbitrated using smart city network traffic data set. In order to make processing easier, the features are normalized using Min–Max normalization. A subset of features suitable for attack detection can be evaluated with Pearson Correlation Coefficient. A feature distance map method is proposed for extracting correlations between features between records. Manhattan distance measures are used to generate the feature distance maps. The feature distance maps enhance the statistical analysis process. Hellinger distance measure is used to generate the normal traffic profile by calculating the degree of similarity between the feature distance map of each record and the normal traffic profile mean. On the basis of the proposed threshold, the Hellinger distance is used to evaluate whether an unknown traffic data belongs to normal or attack. Compared with Mahalanobis distance-based DoS detection, the Hellinger distance-based attack detection takes less time to execute. Based on the theoretical and experimental results, the proposed DoS attack detection system has a low computational complexity and a low FP rate. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art feature ranking based DoS attack detection systems.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3264670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093961","Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack;feature distance map;Hellinger distance;Mahalanobis distance (MD);Manhattan distance;smart city;statistical analysis","Feature extraction;Smart cities;Telecommunication traffic;Internet of Things;Information filters;Correlation coefficient;Correlation","","4","","51","IEEE","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The concept of edge computing brings a new paradigm to monitor and manage network traffic at the network’s edge. Network traffic classification is a critical task to monitor and identify Internet traffic. Recent traffic classification works suggested using statistical flow features to classify network traffic accurately using machine learning techniques. The selected classification features must be stable and can work across different spatial and temporal heterogeneity. This paper proposes a feature selection mechanism called Ensemble Weight Approach (EWA) for selecting significant features for Internet traffic classification based on multi-criterion ranking and selection mechanisms. Extensive simulations have been conducted using publicly-available traces from the University of Cambridge. The simulation results demonstrate that EWA is capable of identifying stable features subset for Internet traffic identification. EWA-selected features improve the mean accuracy up to 1.3% and reduce RMSE using fewer features than other feature selection methods.

Furthermore, the selected features can train stable traffic classification generative models irrespective of the dataset’s spatial and temporal differences, with consistent accuracy up to 97%.

However, the existing symmetric SE (SSE) schemes pay less attention to multiuser environments and users’ interest, which cause poor experience to users. In this article, we propose a multiuser personalized ciphertext search scheme (MPCS) by extending deep learning technology and SSE technology, which can achieve personalized retrieval and multiuser retrieval at the same time. MPCS achieves secure transmission of document keys and fine-grained access control by combining matrix decomposition and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology, which assigns different private keys to each authorized user in the system and allows setting different access rights for different users. Second, we build an interest model for different users and design a user query update algorithm based on the attention mechanism to provide personalized ranking results, which improves the retrieval experience of users. In addition, the computation overhead of MPCS is lightweight, the size of ciphertext and key will not increase linearly with the number of attribute values, and MPCS supports lightweight document updates, which greatly reduces the computation overhead of the system. Formal security analysis verifies the security of MPCS, and simulation experiments on real data sets show that MPCS is feasible and efficient in practice.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3305359","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2702700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102017,62001055); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L222050,M22038); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:YWF-23-L-1240); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10217171","Deep learning;multiuser;personalize;privacy protection;searchable encryption (SE)","Cloud computing;Encryption;Internet of Things;Servers;Security;Deep learning;Access control;Search methods","","","","37","IEEE","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the collected spatiotemporal data by traffic sensor network often suffer from missing values (MVs), which affect the overall performance of the system. As a result, accurate recovery of MVs is essential for the successful application of IoT in transportation. In this article, we propose a novel MVs imputation model by integrating low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) and sparse self-representation into a unified framework. In doing so, the global multidimensional correlation, as well as sample self-similarity, can be well leveraged for imputation. In order to solve the proposed model, an elaborate solution algorithm is developed, following the principle of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). Importantly, each step in ADMM can be implemented efficiently by analyzing the problem structure. Moreover, in order to select proper parameters for the model, an improved harmony search heuristic algorithm based on dual harmonies generation strategy is developed, thus sufficiently considering the information contained in current harmony memory. The experiments on two real-world traffic data are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach. The results verify that in comparison with the classic matrix/tensor completion and other competing algorithms, our method significantly improves the imputation performance.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3172447","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773184,62176140); Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province(grant numbers:tsqn202103118); Six Talent Peaks Project of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:2017-JXQC-007); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0105000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9768132","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs);sparse representation;spatiotemporal data;tensor completion","Tensors;Data models;Correlation;Probabilistic logic;Internet of Things;Transportation;Mathematical models","","7","","56","IEEE","4 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All cloud vendors are not the same in terms of the number of services, infrastructure availability, security strategies, cost per customer, and reputation in the market. Thus, software developers and organizations face a dilemma when choosing a suitable cloud vendor for their developmental activities. Thus, there is a need to evaluate various cloud service providers (CSPs) and platforms before choosing a suitable vendor. Already existing solutions are either based on simulation tools as per the requirements or evaluated concerning the quality of service attributes. However, they require more time to collect data, simulate and evaluate the vendor. The proposed work compares various CSPs in terms of major metrics, such as establishment, services, infrastructure, tools, pricing models, market share, etc., based on the comparison, parameter ranking, and weightage allocated. Furthermore, the parameters are categorized depending on the priority level. The weighted average is calculated for each CSP, after which the values are sorted in descending order. The experimental results show the unbiased selection of CSPs based on the chosen parameters. The proposed parameter-ranking priority level weightage (PRPLW) algorithm simplifies the selection of the best-suited cloud vendor in accordance with the requirements of software development.","2097-406X","","10.26599/BDMA.2022.9020016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026515","cloud-based software development life cycle (SDLC);cloud evaluation;parameter-ranking priority level weightage (PRPLW) algorithm;cloud service providers;software engineering","Measurement;Software algorithms;Globalization;Quality of service;Pricing;Organizations;Software","","2","","16","","26 Jan 2023","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

But privacy concerns are one of the major obstacles to making use of public cloud platforms. Multidimensional anonymisation, a global-recoding generalisation scheme for privacy-preserving data publishing, has been a recent focus due to its capability of balancing data obfuscation and usability. Existing multidimensional anonymisation methods suffer from scalability problems when handling big data due to the impractical serial I/O cost. Given the recursive feature of multidimensional anonymisation, parallelisation is an ideal solution to scalability issues. However, it is still a challenge to use existing distributed and parallel paradigms directly for recursive computation. In this paper, we propose a scalable approach for big data multidimensional anonymisation based on MapReduce, a state-of-the-art data processing paradigm. Our basic idea is to partition a data set recursively into smaller partitions using MapReduce until all partitions can fit in the memory of a computing node. A tree indexing structure is proposed to achieve recursive computation. Moreover, we show the applicability of our approach to differential privacy. Experimental results on real-life data demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the scalability of multidimensional anonymisation over existing methods.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2787661","New Zealand Marsden Fund(grant numbers:17-UOA-248); UoA Faculty Research Development Fund(grant numbers:3714668); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1001800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61402258,61672276); EU FP7 CROWN(grant numbers:PIRSES-GA-2013-610524); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240631","Big data;privacy preservation;MapReduce;data anonymisation;differential privacy","Data privacy;Big Data;Privacy;Scalability;Cloud computing;Partitioning algorithms;Indexing","","22","","39","IEEE","27 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typical algorithms derived from Word Aligned Hybrid (WAH) are COMPressed Adaptive indeX (COMPAX) and Compressed “n” Composable Integer Set (CONCISE), which can combine either two or three continuous words after WAH encoding. COMBAT combines both mechanisms and results in more compact bitmap indexes. Moreover, querying time of COMBAT can be faster than that of COMPAX and CONCISE, since bitmap indexes are smaller and it would take less time to load them into memory. To prove the advantages of COMBAT, we extend a theoretical analysis model proposed by our group, which is composed of the analysis of various possible bitmap indexes.

A novel hybrid index called RnetBE is proposed, which exquisitely organizes traffic network structure, Boolean expressions, and spatial information of subscriptions. And RnetBE can prune huge numbers of unqualified subscriptions based on both spatial constraint and Boolean expressions, thus achieving high efficiency in indexing and matching. Moreover, range-tree deletion and orderly group processing optimization techniques are proposed to save storage space and further improve the subscription pruning efficiency.

We study a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting that mandates probing all the arms periodically while keeping track of the best current arm in a piece-wise stationary environment. We develop TS-GE that balances the regret guarantees of the classical Thompson sampling (TS) with the broadcast probing (BP) of all the arms simultaneously in order to actively detect a change in the reward distributions. The main innovation is in identifying the changed arm by an optional indexing subroutine called group exploration (GE) that scales as  $\log _{2}(K)$  for a  $K-$ armed bandit setting. We characterize the probability of missed detection and the probability of false alarms in terms of environmental parameters. We highlight the conditions for which the regret guarantee of TS-GE outperforms that of the state-of-the-art passively-adaptive and actively-adaptive algorithms, in particular, ADSWITCH.

Outsourcing IIoT data to a third-party cloud service provider (CSP) introduces several data privacy and integrity issues related to verifying the reliability of users’ queries and aggregated outcomes. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based framework for provisioning a privacy-preserving and verifiable query facility to end-users in IIoT systems. The framework uses blockchain to store IoT data as on-chain data and the cloud to store extensive data (e.g., image) as off-chain data and provisioning search services to users by executing a query in both on-chain and off-chain data and generating an aggregated result. Besides, it introduces a new privacy-preserving query mechanism for ensuring sensitive data privacy during query execution. A data owner encrypts both on-chain and off-chain data in the privacy-preserving query mechanism before sending it to the blockchain and cloud. A CSP can perform search operations on the encrypted on-chain and off-chain data to ensure sensitive data privacy. A multisignature-powered query verification model is also built for the blockchain. The query verification model allows each blockchain node to endorse the query result individually and a user to verify the endorsement of the query result before use. The experiments revealed the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3105527","Qatar Foundation(grant numbers:NPRP11S-1227-170135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9516973","Blockchain;cloud computing;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);privacy;privacy preservation;verifiable query","Industrial Internet of Things;Blockchains;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Supply chains;Encryption;Unmanned aerial vehicles","","25","","28","IEEE","18 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing storage systems cannot manage data and support the QoS of mobile services well. This paper presents LKSM, a light weight key-value storage system, which can be deployed on either one node or multiple nodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose key-value store in this scenario. We carefully analyze the challenges when designing the system on mobile clusters, and further propose RDS for addressing. With the help of RDS, LKSM achieves the goal of lower latency, better scalability, and higher availability. Furthermore, based on RDS, a novel data management strategy is presented, which successfully avoid energy holes of mobile clusters and achieves the tradeoff between performance and energy. We organize LKSM using a log-structured merge-tree and implement it based on LevelDB, an open source key-value storage system proposed by Google.

In many cases, individual or specific approaches have been developed for feature selection (FS) on a certain dataset, but collecting the diversity dataset and demonstrating it through different FS methods are challenging. Thus, this article proposed multiapproaches for FS with the classification of diverse datasets. The proposed framework is developed using various methods, such as extendable particle swarm optimization (PSO), global and local searching, feature ranking, feature clustering, computational cost-based FS, and multiobjective optimization. We effectively used these methods in our proposed work in a single-setting framework. We focused on three essential computational items in our framework: classification accuracy, selected features, and computational times. Due to the diverse dataset, few methods have been considered challenging during computational evaluation for classification accuracy with test cost. We tried to manage the classification accuracy based on total cost and high accuracy with less cost. The proposed framework is experimented with the above methods and analyzed through comparative results on diversity datasets. For example, when regular parameter values are in the range of  $2^{-13}$ – $2^{-6}$ , the evaluation result affects all items, i.e., decreasing during this range; other values do not affect results.

This article proposes a smart reservation system considering the behavior of EV users, parking slot availability (PSA), state-of-charge (SoC) value of EVs, and PL usage history of EV users. In order to handle weighting the behavior of EV users according to a comprehensive criteria comparison, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) from multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques is used in the smart reservation system. Thereafter, the proposed ranking function is presented to develop the mentioned quality-of-experience (QoE)-based charging slot allocation considering the reservation requests of EV users sent via a mobile application and to accept the optimal EVs in accordance with the weights assigned by AHP. The proposed concept is tested under different cases generated by changing the individual importance degree of EV user’s criteria. The different case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decision-based multicriteria reservation system in terms of EV users’ acceptance ratio. Simulation results show that not only the importance degree related to the EV users’ criteria has an important effect in accepting appropriate EV users but also PSA management is another vital criterion especially in peak-load hours.","2332-7782","","10.1109/TTE.2021.3067953","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(grant numbers:119E646); 1515 Frontier Research and Development Laboratories Support Program(grant numbers:5169902); Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA) under the Distinguished Young Scientist Programme (GEBIP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9383019","Electric vehicle (EV);multicriteria decision-making (MCDM);parking lots (PLs);reservation system;resource allocation","Resource management;Pricing;Automobiles;Internet of Things;History;Mobile applications;Analytic hierarchy process","","15","","42","IEEE","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper fosters the advantages of the cloud-based computing frameworks (such as MAMLS) and presents a practical work-flow well-suited for the standard machine learning tasks seen in medical image research viz., binary classification, multi-class learning, regression and so on. The proposed automated generalized workflow allows medical researchers/practitioners to focus on data inferencing rather than dealing with the intricate details of predictive modeling, such as feature and model selection. The scalable architecture of the proposed flow utilizes the MAMLS framework to processes data sets that require partial core storage space in the virtual machine to one complete core storage space in a common flow. Also, the proposed flow invokes multiple feature ranking and predictive models in parallel for automated selection and parameterization of the optimal data model. The performance of the proposed flow is bench-marked on 14 public data sets and four local medical image data sets (~0.12 MB-1.22 GB) using a single common flow, while ensuring better (~8% improvement) or atleast similar generalization capability with respect to existing works.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2605641","a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Research Award; University of Washington Bothell Initiatives Group Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559702","Microsoft Azure;machine leaning;medical image;cloud-computing;hyper-parameter search;feature selection","Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Data models;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Data analysis;Computer architecture","","13","","56","OAPA","2 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our proposed CBFS scheme first calculates the distance between feature vectors, merges these feature vectors into different clusters, and selects the center of each cluster as a representative feature vector. The proposed CBFS scheme then integrates the information gain and gain rate of features to further streamline the number of features on the basis of clustering generation. Finally, the proposed CBFS scheme applies the decision-tree-based classifier to the generated subset of features so that the abnormal traffic flows are detected. The experimental results show that our proposed CBFS scheme is effective in reducing feature dimensions across different datasets.

It is a fine-grained many-to-many cross-modal problem and more challenging than those with the image and the attribute as queries. The existing attempts are still weak in bridging the semantic gap between visual modality from different camera sensors and text modality from natural language descriptions. We propose a deep person search approach with a natural language description query by employing the attention mechanism (AM) and multimodal alignment (MA) method to supervise the cross-modal mapping. Particularly, the AM consists of two self-attention modules and one cross-attention module, where the former aims at learning discriminative representations and the latter supervises each other with their own information to offer accurate guidance to a common space. The MA approach contains three alignment processes with a novel cross-ranking loss function to make different matching pairs separable in a common space.

VIoT terminal devices often face a challenge, where collected data are contaminated by noise or contain partial observed information, which can adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of tagged results. In view of such, this study proposes resilient and perceptual data signature generation for robustly tagging captured data based on low-rank semidefinite relaxation. Such signatures can represent data in a compact way while embedding label information inside at the same time. To increase the robustness and effectiveness of data tagging in the proposed method, nonconvex loss called leaky-minimax concave penalty function is studied. This loss function effectively tackles the challenges posed by partially observed data and instance-pairwise label-space mapping, subsequently improving the reliability and accuracy of the tagging process in the terminal devices. To solve the challenges associated with nonconvex loss functions, this study employs the majorization-minimization technique, which helps conquer the nonconvex optimization problem efficiently. Additionally, low-rank semidefinite relaxation is applied to the formation of data signatures to avoid discrete variable optimization problems caused by Laplacian graph embedding, where data locality learning is performed. The relaxation helps simplify the optimization process and improve the applicability of the method. Experimental evaluations conducted on open datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method compared with the baselines, particularly under different data corruption conditions. The results showed an improvement of 19.45%, 8.97%, and 5.45% in F1 scores, with respect to impulse noise, continuous occlusion, and missing values.

Our proposed algorithms are suitable for datasets with a large sample space and can protect the trajectory privacy of truck drivers while preserving the strong correlation between adjacent spatio-temporal nodes in the trajectory.

It employs balanced random forest and multiple instance learning based on event logs from ships’ electric propulsion systems. The objectives are predicting failure likelihood, time to failure, and explainable predictions to ensure timely crew intervention. The IPdM approach uncovers, then learns, and classifies sequences of events that represent early causes or symptoms to forecast imminent failures. In particular, this article contributes effective solutions to irregular, imbalanced, and unlabeled data issues where conventional methods become obsolete. First, the events occur at irregular intervals; they include alarms, warnings, and operational information collected across multiple units and control systems. Second, the datasets exhibit extreme imbalance due to few failures and multiple failure modes; this entails biased predictions. Third, the training datasets are weakly labeled; only the failure timestamp is known without any expert input on prior causes or early symptoms. Temporal random indexing is proposed to transform textual log messages into a numerical lower dimensional space where timeseries analyses are applicable. Balanced random-forest models are developed for unbiased classification and regression. The overall approach learns recursively the ungiven data labels while training the base learners. The IPdM approach is validated through millions of events of multithousand types collected from two years of seagoing vessels. It successfully forecasts actual propulsion failures and performs better when compared with contemporary methods.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3144177","Norwegian Research Council Research-Based Innovation Center BigInsight(grant numbers:237718); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684935","Alarm system;balanced random forest (B-RF);event-driven predictive maintenance;event logs;failure prediction;imbalance;inexact labeling;inverter;liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers;multiple instance learning (MIL);ship electric propulsion system;temporal random indexing (TRI);time to failure (t2f);weakly supervised learning","Maintenance engineering;Propulsion;Marine vehicles;Predictive maintenance;Informatics;Random forests;Radio frequency","","11","","35","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, conventional intrusion detection systems encounter difficulties in managing imbalanced data scenarios, wherein the count of normal instances vastly exceeds that of intrusion instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for 6G-enabled consumer electronics device intrusion detection, leveraging the power of federated meta-learning and digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment. By leveraging the distributed intelligence of meta-learning across a network of devices, our framework enables efficient and accurate detection of intrusions while mitigating the impact of imbalanced data.

These networked devices, empowered with computing and communications, usually exhibit an exponential increment in network traffic to enhance the end-user quality of experience (QoE). The exponential increase in network traffic makes the traditional communication system congested. To reduce the burden of network traffic, the data could be offloaded to device-to-device (D2D)-based infrastructure. This offloading scheme results in an innovative, eco-friendly, and sustainable data dissemination approach known as social networking and is mostly done in opportunistic ways. In this paper, we propose a scheme to explore the performance of the existing routing protocols with the movements and spatial closeness relations among ‘things’, termed as Internet of Moving Things (IoMT). The spatial closeness known as traces will help to make optimal data offloading decisions while considering the mobility traces of humans in the social network. The proposed mechanism is designed to optimally utilize moving physical objects to be involved as a third party in the data communication process between the sources and the destinations rather than using the traditional infrastructure while considering the quality of service (QoS).

To accurately predict the impact of different institutions in the eight top conferences: FSE, ICML, KDD, MM, MobiCom, SIGCOMM, SIGIR, and SIGMOD, a novel model was proposed in which the number of accepted papers of each institution, country, and time factors driving the impact of institution change are used as training features.

BAdDroIds executes in background and transparently analyzes the applications as soon as they are installed, i.e., before infecting the device. BAdDroIds relies on static analysis techniques and features provided by the Android OS to build up sound and complete models of Android apps in terms of permissions and API invocations. It uses ad-hoc supervised classification techniques to allow resource-efficient malware detection. By exploiting the intrinsic nature of data, it has been possible to implement a state-of-the-art data-driven model which provides deep insights on the detection problem and can be efficiently executed on the device itself as it requires a very limited computational effort.

To support the increasing number of smart end devices and their requirement for intelligent data processing, numerous learning-based applications will be deployed at the edge network to provide services with an acceptable level of latency. However, such applications assume that the training and the actual data are independent and identically distributed, which is impractical in the dynamic and heterogeneous environment of the real world. This makes service matchmaking a challenge because even if the service functionality matches user requirements, the mismatched actual data will inevitably result in the degradation of service quality. This paper targets the mismatching issue of learning-based applications and the high requirement of intelligent data processing at the network edge and proposes a novel service provisioning model. This model introduces a novel service description model to resolve data mismatch, a clustering algorithm that pre-processes requests to deal with high concurrency requirements, and a heuristic joint service searching method to reduce traffic costs.

The rapid evolution of blockchain research papers in recent years has resulted in a need to conduct research studies that investigate a detailed analysis of the current body of knowledge in this field. To address this need, a few review papers have been published to report the latest accomplishments and challenges of blockchain technology from different perspectives. Nonetheless, there has not been any bibliometric analysis of the state of the art in blockchain where Web of Science (WoS) has been taken into consideration as a literature database. Hence, a thorough analysis of the current body of knowledge in blockchain research through a bibliometric study would be needed.

Designing and evaluating the quick enough forwarding plane with high capacity is a major challenge within the overall NDN research area. Since NDN was proposed in 2010, there have been many efforts focusing on this challenge and a rich literature has been developed. Unfortunately, there is a lack of the comprehensive sketch about the requirements of NDN forwarding plane and the study on various schemes proposed. Focusing on the above insufficiency, this survey gives the complete requirements and compares all the schemes proposed for NDN forwarding plane based on the data structure utilized.

With the increasing utilization of these systems, their fault detection and diagnosis has become more significant for maintaining their operation and performance. The rapid development of data analytics has led to fault detection and diagnosis using data-based algorithms considering building intelligence. Feature engineering, which focuses on generating near minimum and optimal model inputs from the original dataset, is a fundamental technique to balance efficiency and accuracy of fault detection and diagnosis models. The generated inputs are fault features which ensures a better description of fault operations owing to their stronger fault indicative capability than original data. However, since most feature engineering research has been implemented alongside the development of data-based algorithms, most studies fail to effectively distinguish and understand their roles in fault detection and diagnosis models. To fill this research gap, this study presented the problems and mechanisms associated with feature engineering, comprehensively reviewed about 200 papers on the topic of feature engineering for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration system fault detection and diagnosis tasks over the past 15 years. Firstly, feature engineering studies are divided according to their feature-generation technique, into manual and automated techniques. Next, feature engineering studies are analysed in terms of data type, system type, fault type, operation statue, methods and fault features. The desirable characteristics of feature engineering works are then discussed in terms of their capability of rapidly generating indicative, decoupled, interpretable and new fault features to enhance fault detection and diagnosis accuracy; the efficiency, reliability and robustness of feature engineering process; the mutual adaptability between feature engineering and fault detection and diagnosis; and their widespread applicability for more fault types and system operations. The challenges affecting feature engineering studies are discussed in terms of data volume, data diversity and quality, along with the performance evaluation of feature engineering with respect to feature engineering algorithms, fault detection and diagnosis models, fault features and online application constraints. Future work should aim to design a hybrid, heuristic, robust and automated feature engineering strategy under the guidance of expert knowledge and practical application constraints that consider the relationships between fault-related features and real-time fault impacts with energy consumption, occupants' thermal comfort, etc.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040980","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51906181); Excellent Young and Middle-Aged Talent in Universities of Hubei, China(grant numbers:Q20181110); Excellent Young and Middle-Aged Scientific and Technological Innovative Team in Universities of Hubei, China(grant numbers:T201829); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, China(grant numbers:2016CFB472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9281046","Building energy system;data analytics;feature engineering (FE);fault detection and diagnosis (FDD);fault-related feature (FF);heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R)","Feature extraction;Fault detection;Data models;Computational modeling;Buildings;Iron;Air conditioning","","28","","302","CCBYNCND","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compressing and expanding the amplitudes of some of these OFDM signals, usually referred to as companding, is a peak-to-average power ratio reduction technique that distorts the amplitudes of OFDM signals towards a uniform distribution. We suggest its application in PLC systems, such as IEEE 1901 powerline standard (which uses OFDM) to reduce the impacts of IN. This is because the PLC channel picks up impulsive interference that the conventional OFDM driver cannot combat. We explore, therefore, five widely used companding schemes that convert the OFDM signal amplitude distribution to uniform distribution to avail the mitigation of IN in PLC system receivers by blanking, clipping and their hybrid (clipping-blanking). We also apply nonlinear optimization search to find the optimal mitigation thresholds and results show significant improvement in the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all companding transforms considered of up to 4 dB SNR gain. It follows that the conventional PDF leads to false IN detection, which diminishes the output SNR when any of the above three nonlinear memoryless mitigation schemes is applied.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2747629","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N03466X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051038","Companding;OFDM;powerline communication (PLC);impulsive noise (IN);peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR);amplitude distribution;optimization;uniform distribution","Peak to average power ratio;Transforms;Signal to noise ratio;Probability density function;Standards;Receivers","","16","","37","CCBY","26 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we conduct a three-tier hierarchical service system with multiple mobile users(UEs), multiple mobile edge computing servers(MECs), and a single cloud center(CC). It is worth noting that multiple UEs with personalized options generate a large number of different tasks in real time. To deal with this complex offloading problem, a response ratio offloading strategy (RROS) centered on user preference and real-time nature is designed to make MECs or CC serve as many UEs as possible. Therefore, a MEC-choosing preference list of each UE is created based on its past experiences at first. Then, each MEC iteratively sorts UEs with its ranking in the UEs’ preference list. In order to avoid that the first task arriving at MEC occupies too many resources of MEC and cannot achieve global optimization, we also adopt loop iterative sequencing for multiple tasks arriving within a stipulated time. Lastly, by comparing the optimal response ratio on different MECs and CC, multiple MECs and the CC collaborative offload computing tasks of multiple UEs. We demonstrate numerical examples and data of the proposed strategy.

In this article, we propose a family of compressed FIB data structures that significantly reduce the required storage space within the NDN routers. Our first compressed FIB data structure is FCTree. FCTree employs a localized front-coding compression, that eliminates repeated prefixes, to buckets containing partitions of routes. These buckets are then organized in self-balancing trees to speed up the longest prefix match (LPM) operations. We propose two enhancements to FCTree, a statistically compressed FCTree (StFCTree) and a dictionary compressed FCTree (DiFCTree). Both StFCTree and DiFCTree achieve higher compression ratios for NDN FIBs and can be used for FIB updates or exchanges between the forwarding and control planes. Finally, we provide the control plane with several knobs that can be employed to achieve different target trade-offs between the lookup speed and the FIB size in each of these structures.

Specifically, we propose a Taylor criterion ranking based network pruning strategy to remove the nonessential neurons so as to reduce the computational complexity and storage requirement, and design a network quantization strategy to quantize network parameters so as to further reduce the storage requirement. We design a mmWave-based device-free gesture recognition testbed to evaluate the proposed strategies.

The main problem lies in storing these files in their raw form, over long time, to allow analysis processes to be run at any time enabling information to be extracted as foundation for high quality decisions. Our research focuses on offering an economical, secure, and high-performance solution for the storage of large amount of raw log files. Proposed system implements a Data Lake (DL) architecture in cloud using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) for extract–load–transform (ELT) pipelines. This architecture allows large volumes of data to be stored in their raw form. Afterwards they can be subjected to transformation and advanced analysis processes without the need of a structured writing scheme. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a solution that is affordable and more accessible to perform web server access log data ingestion, storage and transformation over the newest technology, Data Lake. As derivative contribution, we proposed the use of Azure Blob Trigger Function to implement the algorithm of transforming log files into parquet files leading to 90% reduction in storage space compared to their original size. That means much lower storage costs than if they had been stored as log files. A hierarchical data storage model has also been proposed for shared access to data over different layers in the DL architecture, on top of which Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) rules have been proposed for storage cost efficiency. We proposed ingesting log files into a Data Lake deployed in cloud due to ease of deployment and low storage costs. The aim is to maintain this data in the long term, to be used in future advanced analytics processes by cross-referencing with other organizational or external data. That could bring important benefits. While the proposed solution is explicitly based on ADLS Gen2, it represents an important benchmark in approaching a cloud DL solution offered by any other vendor.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3270368","ANTREPRENORDOC, in the framework of Human Resources Development Operational Programme 2014–2020; European Social Fund(grant numbers:36355/23.05.2019 HRD OP /380/6/13–SMIS,123847); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107911","Cloud data lake;ADLS Gen2;data lake architecture;web server access log data;Azure function Blob trigger","Computer architecture;Web servers;Big Data applications;Costs;Data models;Companies;Data mining","","4","","40","CCBYNCND","25 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study found that the current problems of data protection on Internet enterprise platforms include: extremely weak user data protection measures, intellectual property risks throughout the whole process of big data processing, and infringements that have both new and high-tech characteristics. The high ambiguity in the definition and attribution of “data rights”, the low cost and high concealment of infringements, and the value difference between intellectual property protection and digital economy are the main causes of these problems.

Motivated by the facts that evolutionary operators are sensitive to the properties of problems, and even different search stages of an evolutionary operator often pose distinct properties when solving a problem. So far, numerous ensemble approaches have been designed to adaptively choose evolutionary operators for evolving population during different optimization stages. Then, during one stage, all the subproblems/subspaces in these existing ensemble approaches use the same evolutionary operator. But, for a complex MOP, the properties of its subproblems/subspaces are different. Based on the fact that existing ensemble approaches ignore this point, this article develops a fine-grained ensemble approach, namely FGEA, to choose suitable evolutionary operators for different subspaces during one generation. To be specific, the local and global contributions for each evolutionary operator in each subproblem/subspace are first defined. Then, an adaptive strategy is designed to encourage evolutionary operators making more contributions to obtain more opportunities to generate more offspring solutions. When choosing an evolutionary operator for a subspace, the proposed adaptive strategy considers both the local and global contributions of the evolutionary operators. Finally, based on 35 complex MOPs, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed FGEA by comparing it with five baseline algorithms. The experimental results reveal the competitive performance of the FGEA, which achieves the lowest inverted generational distance (IGD) values and the highest hypervolume values on 20 and 19 MOPs, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046002","Guangzhou Social Science Planning Department(grant numbers:2020GZGJ160); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300140","Evolutionary computation;multi-objective optimization;fine-grained ensemble;complex Pareto set","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Convergence;Search problems","","2","","56","CCBY","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We shift the target cache users search task from the local area to the base station by the OTULS. Based on the target cache users, we search for the target user with the shortest distance from the requester at local. In addition, to avoid selecting selfish users with the shortest distance from the target cache users, we manage the users’ reputations through a blockchain.

However, the current error control and WSN coverage of DV-Hop node positioning are not enough for practical applications. This research innovatively adopts an improved sparrow search pattern to optimise the DV-Hop localisation algorithm. The study introduces a deviation correction factor to adjust the minimum number of node hops and uses the minimum mean squared error criterion to correct the calculation error to reduce error. In addition, the study improved the sparrow search algorithm by means of a GPS optimisation population initialisation. In the algorithm performance comparison, GSSA showed the best convergence efficiency compared to other algorithms. The average error of the GSSADV-Hop localisation constructed in the study is 0.72 m, which is 77.71% less than the traditional DV-Hop error.

One way to achieve this is to introduce the provider’s reputation, i.e., a quality indicator of the provisioned service, as an additional search criterion. Now, with blockchain technology in our hands, automated regulation of service-level agreements (SLAs) that capture mutual agreements between all involved parties has regained momentum.

These models notably minimize/exclude the involvement of developers in the composition, maintenance, and evolution of software systems. Despite extensive research on self-adaptive systems, systematic reviews focusing specifically on ESSs are lacking. This paper addresses this gap by performing a systematic literature review on ESSs. Our goal is to equip researchers and industry practitioners with a comprehensive view of existing ESSs, enabling them to select approaches that meet their requirements and identify potential research avenues. The research questions are centered around knowing what ESSs are and identifying the set of activities essential for their creation. From an initial collection of 496 papers identified through search engines, 39 papers met our inclusion and exclusion criteria for retention and in-depth analysis. Finally, we build a taxonomy to categorize existing ESS approaches and dissect various ESS definitions to pinpoint their main characteristics. The taxonomy is structured around the goals, processes and usability of ESSs. Our research reveals an emphasis on non-functional adaptation objectives within current ESSs. Despite this focus, the majority of existing ESSs are still in the proof-of-concept phase and have undergone minimal testing in industrial settings. While present ESS investigations largely revolve around areas such as web service computing, internet of things, and cyber-physical systems, we advocate for further exploration of their potential utility in other application domains such as robotics, aerospace, and unmanned vehicles.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3369903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10445183","Emergent software systems;automatic computing;self-learning;self-adaptation","Software systems;Adaptation models;Usability;Systematics;Monitoring;Maintenance engineering;Computers;Self-supervised learning;Learning systems;Autonomous systems","","","","51","CCBYNCND","26 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recursively utilized gains reinforce and accelerate growth. Expanding on modern portfolio management, autonomous TradingBots diversify portfolios like inventories not only in terms of asset weighting, but also with respect to holding periods and moreover, do so in real-time. TradingBots can also be deployed to test automation, collaboration, portfolio, and inventory strategies. Metrics from modern portfolio management used show that StockExBots are able to outperform high-ranking index and actively managed funds.

However, devices that are not within their proximity area communicate with other devices (relay). In this paper, we propose a device-centric scheme for relay selection in a dynamic network scenario. In this scheme, once the communicating devices have reached the maximum distance threshold, they exchange neighbor tables and find common devices (relay) for further communication. In addition, we propose a new relay selection scheme for scenarios, where the devices have more than one device (relay) in common. The proposed relay selection scheme is based on several parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, residual battery power, buffer space, and reliability; this provides more reliable and efficient communication. The current relay schemes, including max-min and max-max, are network assisted; the network/BS decides the relay, which increases the load on the BS side. The BS selects relay based on channel state information or SNR, which does not provide efficient or reliable communication. Our proposed device-centric scheme depends less on the BS during relay selection, which reduces network overhead, and the relay selection scheme provides more efficient and reliable communication. A comparison with other relay selection schemes shows that our scheme is 30% more effective in each case.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2581920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7533537","5G relay;device centric architecture;device to device;relay selection;neighbour table;threshold","5G mobile communication;Network architecture;Relays;Base stations;Channel state information;Communication channels;Signal to noise ratio","","24","","42","OAPA","4 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the design of IPv6 is incompatible with that of its predecessor IPv4 and slows down the development of the IPv4-to-IPv6 migration. Several transitioning mechanisms have been proposed to attain the compatibility of IPv4 and IPv6 to bridge the gap between these two heterogeneous protocols. The two protocols would need to coexist continually before IPv6 completely takes over IPv4. However, the existing captive portal authentication systems generally do not support IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack authentication and lack one-time dual-stack authentication solutions. Upgrading the authentication system has become an urgent problem to be addressed. This study presents dual-stack network management strategies using a novel one-time authentication mechanism for large and complex dual-stack network environments. The proposed authentication system resolves the inconvenience of separate IPv4 and IPv6 authentication and effectively improves the compatibility of the two protocols. Furthermore, authenticating both IPv4 and IPv6 increases the traceability of traffic logs when security attacks occur.

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas. The defenders can use the knowledge of such correlation between attack location and its impact to set higher security levels at particular positions by monitoring sensitive network parameters and detecting the anomalies.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2266399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525333","RPL;Rank attack;performance;security;internal threat","Topology;Network topology;Wireless sensor networks;Routing protocols;Performance evaluation;Sensors;Quality of service","","130","","7","IEEE","6 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three of the four comparison methods are based on the well known, classical batch k-means model. Specifically, we use k-means, single pass k-means, online k-means, and clustering using representatives (CURE) for numerical comparisons. clusiVAT is based on sampling the data, imaging the reordered distance matrix to estimate the number of clusters in the data visually, clustering the samples using a relative of single linkage (SL), and then noniteratively extending the labels to the rest of the data-set using the nearest prototype rule. Previous work has established that clusiVAT produces true SL clusters in compact-separated data. We have performed experiments to show that k-means and its modified algorithms suffer from initialization issues that cause many failures. On the other hand, clusiVAT needs no initialization, and almost always finds partitions that accurately match ground truth labels in labeled data. CURE also finds SL type partitions but is much slower than the other four algorithms. In our experiments, clusiVAT proves to be the fastest and most accurate of the five algorithms; e.g., it recovers 97% of the ground truth labels in the real world KDD-99 cup data (4292637 samples in 41 dimensions) in 76 s.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2477416","Australian Research Council (ARC) Research Network on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing under REDUCE through the Digital Economy Programme run by Research Councils U.K.—a cross council initiative led by EPSRC and contributed to by Arts and Humanities Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Medical Research Council; and ARC(grant numbers:EP/I000232/1,LP120100529,LF120100129); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7283582","Big data cluster analysis;cluster tendency assessment;data analytics;Internet of things;single linkage","Clustering algorithms;Big data;Partitioning algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Image edge detection;Cybernetics;Indexes","","88","","54","IEEE","29 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new random projection, fuzzy c-means based cluster ensemble framework for high-dimensional data. Our framework uses cumulative agreement to aggregate fuzzy partitions. Fuzzy partitions of random projections are ranked using external and internal cluster validity indices. The best partition in the ranked queue is the core (or base) partition. Remaining partitions then provide cumulative inputs to the core, thus, arriving at a consensus best overall partition built from the ensemble.

A centralized controller grants a global view of the sensor network by introducing extra control overhead in the network, but this leads to extra energy costs. However, our new algorithm takes advantage of this global view and balances the network energy by selecting paths with the highest remaining energy level among multiple paths for each sensor node. We also identify key functions draining energy from the SDWSN and minimize their impact by implementing a data packet aggregation function, and minimizing the control overhead by keeping track of the sensor nodes' routing tables using a simple checksum function. We show that the proposed approach prolongs the network lifetime of the WSN by 6.5% on average compared to the standard shortest-path algorithm, and that the control overhead is reduced by approximately 12% while still maintaining a very high packet delivery ratio.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3059789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355188","Centralized routing;Industrial Internet of Things;network lifetime;software defined wireless sensor networks;software-defined routing;wireless sensor networks","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Routing;Industrial Internet of Things;Energy consumption;Wireless communication;Network topology","","51","","30","IEEE","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, malicious social bots post shortened malicious URLs in the tweet in order to redirect the requests of online social networking participants to some malicious servers. Hence, distinguishing malicious social bots from legitimate users is one of the most important tasks in the Twitter network. To detect malicious social bots, extracting URL-based features (such as URL redirection, frequency of shared URLs, and spam content in URL) consumes less amount of time in comparison with social graph-based features (which rely on the social interactions of users). Furthermore, malicious social bots cannot easily manipulate URL redirection chains. In this article, a learning automata-based malicious social bot detection (LA-MSBD) algorithm is proposed by integrating a trust computation model with URL-based features for identifying trustworthy participants (users) in the Twitter network. The proposed trust computation model contains two parameters, namely, direct trust and indirect trust. Moreover, the direct trust is derived from Bayes' theorem, and the indirect trust is derived from the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to determine the trustworthiness of each participant accurately.

However, most such machine learning algorithms are both computation-and-memory intensive, which makes it highly difficult to implement the requisite computations on a single device of limited computation, memory, and energy resources. Wireless distributed computing presents new opportunities by pooling the computation and storage resources among devices. For low-latency applications, the key bottleneck lies in the exchange of intermediate results among mobile devices for data shuffling. To improve communication efficiency, we propose a co-channel communication model and design transceivers by exploiting the locally computed intermediate values as side information. A low-rank optimization model is proposed to maximize the achieved degrees-of-freedom (DoF) by establishing the interference alignment condition for data shuffling. Unfortunately, existing approaches to approximate the rank function fail to yield satisfactory performance due to the poor structure in the formulated low-rank optimization problem. In this paper, we develop an efficient difference-of-convex-functions (DC) algorithm to solve the presented low-rank optimization problem by proposing a novel DC representation for the rank function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DC approach can significantly improve the communication efficiency whereas the achievable DoF almost remains unchanged when the number of mobile devices grows.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2019.2912139","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601290); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:16YF1407700); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1702752,ECCS1711823); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693746","Wireless distributed computing;data shuffling;interference alignment;low-rank optimization;difference-of-convex-functions;DC programming;Ky Fan 2- $k$  norm","Computational modeling;Wireless communication;Distributed databases;Task analysis;Data models;Optimization","","27","","27","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a probabilistic linguistic attribute weight determination method is developed that considers probabilistic linguistic information entropies and the weighted total deviation of all objects from the negative ideal solution (NIS). Then, a new group satisfaction index is designed to replace the utility function in RT, which overcomes the limitation of the RT calculation in PLTSs. Second, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is extended to PLTSs for obtaining equivalent objects under different clusters and calculate conditional probabilities in corresponding TWD models, which makes up for the shortage of the PLTS evaluation matrix when dividing equivalence classes. Third, RT is introduced into PLTSs to rank objects according to utility perception values. At the same time, a new TWD model constructed by average utility perception values is used to realize object domains in probabilistic linguistic environments.

As per the workload requirements of the application's resources should be dynamically allocated for the application. Disparities in resource provisioning produce energy, cost wastages, and additionally, it affects Quality of Service (QoS) and increases Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. So, applications allocated resources quantity should match with the applications required resources quantity. Load balancing in cloud computing can be addressed through optimal scheduling techniques, whereas this solution belongs to the NP-Complete optimization problem category. However, the cloud providers always face resource management issues for variable cloud workloads in the heterogeneous system environment. This issue has been solved by the proposed Predictive Priority-based Modified Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (PMHEFT) algorithm, which can estimate the application's upcoming resource demands. This research contributes towards developing the prediction-based model for efficient and dynamic resource provisioning in a heterogamous system environment to fulfill the end user's requirements. Existing algorithms fail to meet the user's Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as makespan minimization and budget constraints satisfaction, or to incorporate cloud computing principles, i.e., elasticity and heterogeneity of computing resources. In this paper, we proposed a PMHEFT algorithm to minimize the makespan of a given workflow application by improving the load balancing across all the virtual machines. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm's makespan, efficiency, and power consumption are better than other algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9410259","Cloud computing;load balancing;Predictive Priority-based Modified Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time;Quality of Service;Service Level Agreement;scheduling;virtual machine","Task analysis;Load management;Cloud computing;Prediction algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Scheduling","","24","","52","CCBY","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Service recommendation technology satisfies the individual needs of users by collecting, processing, and analyzing user characteristic data. In recent years, service recommendation algorithms based on social networks and collaborative filtering have been widely used in CPSS. However, this type of service recommendation algorithm cannot effectively use the aliasing and auxiliary information in the service, nor can it generate different service recommendation schemes according to different scenarios. We propose a collaborative filtering service recommendation algorithm that combines heterogeneous information networks and topic models for CPSS. The proposed algorithm designs a more effective functional similarity measurement method through the word vectors learned by Word2vec. Then, we use the topic model to cluster the scenario-based service (SBS), thereby greatly reducing the time required for service recommendation. Experimental analysis results show that we finally determine the best combination of Mashup similarity between the two scenarios with better recommendation efficiency and accuracy.

The model is analyzed from a multihop network perspective. We consider two static SD-WSN scenarios to examine scalability, and one scenario to assess the performance implications in a pseudo-dynamic SD-WSN. Extensive simulation results are presented regarding the control overhead introduced, the percentage of alive nodes and remaining energy, and the impacts on network lifetime. We show that the accumulated control overhead is inversely proportional to the interaction period with the controller, whereas the remaining energy and the network lifetime are directly proportional to this parameter. Results show that the control overhead, for static SD-WSNs, can take up to 10%-29% of the total data flowing to the controller for the large SD-WSN and 6-19% for the small SD-WSN.

Sharing channel state information (CSI) and messages across transmitters can potentially alleviate the interferences and improve the system performance. Most existing works on interference coordination require significant CSI signaling overhead and are impractical in the ultra-dense networks. This paper investigates the topological cooperation to manage interferences in message sharing based only on the network connectivity information. In particular, we propose a generalized low-rank optimization approach in a complex field to maximize the achievable degrees of freedom (DoFs) by establishing interference alignment conditions for the topological cooperation. To tackle the challenges of poor structure and non-convex rank function, we develop the Riemannian optimization algorithms to solve a sequence of complex fixed-rank subproblems through a rank growth strategy. By exploiting the non-compact Stiefel manifold formed by the set of complex full column rank matrices, we develop the Riemannian optimization algorithms to solve the complex fixed-rank optimization problem by applying the semidefinite lifting technique and the Burer–Monteiro factorization approach.

Due to the high volume of data shared in the recent years, ML algorithms are more accurate and reliable since training and testing phases are more precise. An important concept to analyze when defining ML algorithms concerns adversarial machine learning attacks. These attacks aim to create manipulated datasets to mislead ML algorithm decisions. In this work, we propose new approaches able to detect and mitigate malicious adversarial machine learning attacks against a ML system. In particular, we investigate the Carlini-Wagner (CW), the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and the Jacobian based saliency map (JSMA) attacks. The aim of this work is to exploit detection algorithms as countermeasures to these attacks. Initially, we performed some tests by using canonical ML algorithms with a hyperparameters optimization to improve metrics. Then, we adopt original reliable AI algorithms, either based on eXplainable AI (Logic Learning Machine) or Support Vector Data Description (SVDD). The obtained results show how the classical algorithms may fail to identify an adversarial attack, while the reliable AI methodologies are more prone to correctly detect a possible adversarial machine learning attack. The evaluation of the proposed methodology was carried out in terms of good balance between FPR and FNR on real world application datasets: Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling, Vehicle Platooning and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In addition, a statistical analysis was performed to improve the robustness of the trained models, including evaluating their performance in terms of runtime and memory consumption.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3197299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852204","Machine learning;detection algorithms;adversarial machine learning;reliable","Machine learning algorithms;Reliability;Adversarial machine learning;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Data models;Safety;Object detection","","11","","60","CCBYNCND","8 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, few existing GDM studies simultaneously focus on the above two characteristics of GDM problems. Moreover, the scenario of multiple decision preferences and the attribute and expert weights based on heterogeneous information are also seldom discussed. Given this, by considering a kind of GDM problem with the characteristics of multisource, heterogeneity, diversity, and multiple fuzzy decisions, this article builds a novel GDM method from the perspective of multigranulation rough sets. First, we construct a new weighted multigranulation generalized fuzzy rough set (WMGGFRS) over multisource heterogeneous fuzzy decision systems. Subsequently, in response to heterogeneous information, the extended entropy weight methods are given to calculate the weight of each attribute and the weight of each expert. After that, we establish a GDM method using the WMGGFRS model to realize multisource information fusion.

Besides, the uncertainty and multistakeholder on sustainable modern agricultural technology assessment (SMATA) have made this appraisal much more complex, including their entanglement with rapidly changing cultural norms and social relations. Thus, in order to address these concerns, this article develops a holistic multistakeholder transdisciplinary approach with supporting SMATA. More precisely, due to the uncertainty of environment and vague knowledge possessed by stakeholders, we first investigate the evaluation measure of SMATA by introducing $q$-rung orthopair fuzzy set ($q$-ROFS). Second, group opinion of stakeholders is fused by developing a new transdisciplinary evaluation aggregation operator. Third, to achieve more robust weights of key factors, three extended best worst method models from three different comparative perspectives of $q$-ROFS are established. The final weight of key factors is further obtained by utilizing the variable entropy method. Fourth, we design a new decision approach of SMATA by improving evaluation based on distance from average solution method. Finally, a modern agricultural project base of Xichang city in China is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed SMATA method, including the simulation experiments on sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.

Therefore, this article innovatively proposes a collaborative artificial intelligence of things data analysis and application framework based on Boolean tensors, which supports the expression and fusion of heterogeneous graph and ultimately promotes the AI processing. In this context, we focus on developing an incremental Boolean tensor factorization (IBTF) approach for efficient knowledge reasoning to meet the requirements of real-time and high-level quality demands for intelligent services. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do this work. More concretely, we present factors update and binary features merge algorithms for the integrated graph tensors to avoid numerous repeated calculations of historical data. Experimental results on general synthetic datasets demonstrate that the IBTF approach proposed in this article guarantees nearly equal approximate accuracy while reducing execution time by dozens and even more of times.

As a result, this article presents a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach in the CIFS setting, which draws inspiration from the CIFS and MSM operators.

Sparse Tucker decomposition is an important algorithm for compressing and analyzing these sparse high-dimensional datasets. When energy efficiency and data privacy are major concerns, hardware accelerators on resource-constraint platforms become crucial for the deployment of tensor algorithms. In this work, we propose a hybrid computing framework containing CPU and FPGA to accelerate sparse Tucker factorization.

Cybersecurity risk assessment (CRA) plays an important role in cybersecurity protection of ICSs. However, the weights of risk indices are constants in traditional CRA methods, and they do not fully consider the requirements of risk identification. In this paper, we define a novel order- $\alpha $  divergence measure for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) and further develop a novel CRA approach for ICSs based on the proposed divergence measure under an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment to contribute to the research gap. First, an order- $\alpha $  divergence measure for IVIFNs is defined considering flexibility and robustness of divergence measures with the parameter. Next, a variable weight-based CRA approach for ICSs is developed. In this approach, IVIFNs are adopted to describe evaluation values of risk indices. The weights of risk indices are variable weight vectors and they are determined by the relative divergence closeness. Integration approaches of each node and each attack path in attack-defense trees (ADTs) are proposed based on the operations of IVIFNs, and risk scores of each attack path are calculated by using the score function. Finally, we apply the proposed method to the CRA of a civil aviation fuel supply automatic control system and verify its effectiveness and advantages by comparing it with other methods. This method can dynamically adjust the weights of risk indices considering the relationship between each risk index and the highest risk, and therefore, it can more effectively recognize the highest risk of ICSs than the traditional CRA method.

In the missing feature approach to speech processing, the unreliable feature components are identified and reconstructed to overcome signal degradation and the mismatch of the acoustic environment. To reduce the model dependency, we investigate the matrix completion technique in missing feature reconstruction tasks. However, most of the matrix completion techniques require a priori tuning parameters, e.g., target rank, which is hard to determine in practice. In this work, we propose a matrix completion method based on matrix factorization for the missing-feature reconstruction task, that does not require model training nor parameter tuning.

Currently, using available yet not necessarily reliable edge resources is common sense for edge space expansion, while deploying deduplication storage strategies is a general method for better space utilization. However, a contradiction arises when jointly implementing data deduplication with unreliable edge resources. On the one hand, the deduplication policy stipulates that any data chunk can be stored exactly once; on the other hand, the use of unreliable resources imposes that data should be backed up for the seek of file availability. To resolve such contradiction, we propose MEAN, a deduplication-enabled storage system using unreliable resources at the network edge. The core idea of MEAN is to place similar files together for better deduplication and maintain replicas of popular files for higher reliability. We first formulate this problem and prove its NP-hardness, then provide efficient heuristics based on similarity-aware hierarchical clustering. Three different reliability scenarios are comprehensively considered to develop our algorithms. We also implement a prototype system and evaluate the performance of MEAN with a real-world dataset. The results show that MEAN can fortify the file hit ratio under unreliable environments by 77% while reducing the file retrieval delay up to 71%, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2023.3305460","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19B2024,62002378); Research Funding of NUDT(grant numbers:ZK20-30); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10219047","Deduplication;fault tolerance;storage system;edge computing","Servers;Redundancy;Clustering algorithms;Resource management;Production;Heuristic algorithms;Delays","","2","","49","CCBY","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When stress becomes constantly overwhelmed and prolonged, it increases the risk of mental health and physiological uneasiness. Furthermore, chronic stress raises the likelihood of mental health plagues such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder. Although measuring stress using physiological parameters such as heart rate variability (HRV) is a common approach, how to achieve ultra-high accuracy based on HRV measurements remains as a challenging task. HRV is not equivalent to heart rate. While heart rate is the average value of heartbeats per minute, HRV represents the variation of the time interval between successive heartbeats. The HRV measurements are related to the variance of RR intervals which stand for the time between successive R peaks. In this study, we investigate the role of HRV features as stress detection bio-markers and develop a machine learning-based model for multi-class stress detection. More specifically, a convolution neural network (CNN) based model is developed to detect multi-class stress, namely, no stress, interruption stress, and time pressure stress, based on both time- and frequency-domain features of HRV. Validated through a publicly available dataset, SWELL–KW, the achieved accuracy score of our model has reached 99.9% (Precision = 1, Recall = 1,  $F1-$  score = 1, and MCC = 0.99), thus outperforming the existing methods in the literature.

However, answering spatial density queries may violate users’ privacy by exposing their locations to an untrusted data collector. In this article, we propose a solution for answering spatial density queries under local differential privacy (LDP), a state-of-the-art privacy protection standard. Our solution consists of four main steps: 1) partitioning; 2) finding sensitivity; 3) user-side noisy response computation; and 4) server-side estimation. For the first step, we propose and analyze three basic partitioning strategies, and based on our analysis, we design an improved strategy called Advanced Partitioning. For the second step, we adapt graph-based modeling of query sets from the centralized differential privacy literature. Advanced Partitioning also leverages and extends this technique by formulating the partitioning problem using vertex coloring. For the third and fourth steps, in addition to adapting two popular LDP protocols (GRR and RAPPOR), we propose a novel extension for the optimized unary encoding protocol. Our new protocol (OBE) is not only applicable to our problem but can also be used in other LDP problems with bitvector encodings. Finally, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation of different partitioning strategies and protocols using multiple real-world data sets.

Towards this, we introduce in this paper a proactive methodology implemented in a system called IDI_CPS. It is based on the observation that CPS devices that have LAN-based network sharing (e.g., via Wi-Fi connections) need first to be clustered using some clustering criterion. Then, the influential and central devices in these clusters need to be identified to pay more attention to their file sharing. These influential devices may have network sharing with devices at the WAN level. Therefore, the influential devices at the WAN level that have network sharing with the influential devices in the clusters need also to be identified to pay more attention to their file sharing. We propose novel techniques for: (1) clustering the devices that have LAN-based network sharing using k-clique modeling, (2) employing clustering coefficient-based techniques for identifying the most influential device in each cluster, and (3) employing Independent Cascades model-based techniques for identifying the influential devices at the WAN level that have network sharing with the influential devices in the clusters.

Through systematic literature review and frequency of occurrence analysis, 10 ethical concerns were selected for further analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis responses of 10 expert panels show that the top concerns, as revealed by their weights, after meeting the consistency requirement, include copyright, legal, and compliance issues (0.1731), privacy and confidentiality (0.1286), academic integrity (0.1206), incorrect reference and citation practices (0.1111), and safety and security concerns (0.1050). Evaluating the impact of these concerns on the policy alternatives (restriction and legislation), the findings revealed that “Restriction” received a higher weight (0.513712) compared to “Legislation” (0.485887). Notably, copyright, legal, and compliance issues, privacy and confidentiality, and academic integrity emerged as crucial factors influencing the decision between restriction and legislation.

However, the existing works still face the following challenges: (1) the manual data processing is time-consuming and labor-intensive while analyzing the massive data with domain knowledge; (2) insufficient attention is given to the analysis of relationships among data collections; and (3) redundant data is not eliminated, leading to excess computational burden. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient automatic data modeling method that employs domain-aware knowledge, significantly reducing the cost of data modeling. Our approach starts by leveraging a knowledge-based classifier to extract domain-related resources from open common single-document summarization datasets (OC-SDS), thus reducing data acquisition expenses. Then after collecting related documents by original summaries, a two-stage filtering process is applied to eliminate redundant and non-related documents. Finally, the original summaries are iteratively updated until reaching the threshold, enhancing informativeness and introducing novel expressions without the need for manual marking. As a practical application, we take emergency news as an example and built a typical dataset based on our method. After an extensive analysis, the empirical results evidence that our method is superior in scale and quality compared to the existing methods, with over 13.7% more related data, providing a valuable contribution to the field of CE product development.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2023.3327216","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1406702-3); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772575,62006257); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10308715","Data-driven modeling;data flow computing;data collection;natural language processing","Correlation;Transformers;Hamming distances;Next generation networking;Data collection;Natural language processing;Data models;Data flow computing","","","","44","IEEE","3 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional forms of remote sensing (e.g., vision) preserve such structure only in limited ways. This paper examines how embedded, form-fitting sensing, referred to as physically integrated (PI) sensing, can preserve such structure in richer ways. While the analysis is agnostic to the particular technology for PI sensing, for which a range of options is emerging, especially driven by the Internet of Things, a particular emerging technology called large-area electronics (LAE) is considered. Using synthetic data from 3-D modeling and rendering of human-activity scenes, LAE-based PI sensing and vision-based remote sensing are emulated and perception systems are formed, showing: 1) enhanced data-efficiency of learning models based on PI sensing; 2) potential for selective deployment of PI sensors in new perception tasks, thanks to robust ranking of their value in such tasks; 3) enhanced data-efficiency of learning models based on vision sensing, by integrating PI sensing; and 4) efficient mapping of PI-sensing features across perception tasks to enhance transferability of learning.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2883905","Semiconductor Research Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8552441","Activity detection;artificial intelligence;Internet of Things (IoT);large-area electronics (LAEs);machine learning;physically integrated (PI) sensing","Task analysis;Internet of Things;Feature extraction;Wearable sensors;Remote sensing;Data models","","5","","53","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Secure and Energy-Efficient Network Topology Obfuscation for Software-Defined WSNs","M. Bin-Yahya; X.

The main challenge is to strike a balance among energy consumption, reliable routing, and security levels due to resource constraints in sensor nodes. Furthermore, software-defined wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are more vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks due to the uncovered pattern of control traffic between the controller and the nodes. In this article, a new energy-aware NTO mechanism is proposed, which maximizes the attack costs and is efficient and practical to be deployed. Specifically, first, a route obfuscation method is proposed by utilizing ranking-based route mutation, based on four different critical criteria: 1) route overlapping; 2) energy consumption; 3) link costs; and 4) node reliability. Then, a sink node obfuscation method is introduced by selecting several fake sink nodes that are indistinguishable from actual sink nodes, according to the  $k$ -anonymity model. As a result, the most suitable routes and sink nodes can be selected, and a highest obfuscation level can be reached without sacrificing energy efficiency. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can strongly mitigate traffic analysis attacks and achieve effective NTO for software-defined WSNs.

Our system request is event-dependent specified in a brand-new event specification language; still, the event is stored and processed by the relational database. We newly formulate the problem of self-organized task distribution subjective to preferable constraints of computation and communication. The solution for each broker to find individual optimal decision is to apply tabu search with flow-based greedy move regarding pre-ranking flow table. Many experiments are conducted to study and evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The simulation shows that the proposed flow optimization outperforms the naïve algorithm, concretely, 2-times more tasks getting processed and successfully delivered within the same fixed period.

To this end, by incorporating the neighborhood rough set (NRS) approach, this article proposes a novel and effective locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method for high-dimensional WMSN data based on the neighborhood (NLSH). This method innovatively combines the neighborhood knowledge representation method with the LSH mechanism and extends the indexing ability of LSH. Moreover, this method does not require any prior knowledge and has good universality. The indexing method of neighborhood bucket building can reduce the number of searches and improve the response speed of the WMSN system. Extensive experiments have been carried out on several real-world multimedia data sets. The results show that a large-scale high-dimensional NLSH search based on the NRS approach can efficiently query the target point and produce very accurate results.

Due to the high spectrum efficiency of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), this paper studies the single-user multi-edge-server MEC system based on downlink NOMA, aiming to minimize task computation delay by jointly optimizing the NOMA-based transmission duration (TD) and workload offloading allocation (WOA) among edge computing servers. This task computation delay minimization (CDM) problem is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. To solve the CDM problem efficiently, we decompose it into the sub-problem of determining the optimal WOA with a given TD and the top-problem of optimizing the TD. For the sub-problem, we first derive its some important properties and then design an efficient channel quality ranking based algorithm to obtain the optimal WOA. We solve the top-problem for the static-channel and dynamic-channel scenarios, respectively. For the static-channel scenario, we design an optimal algorithm which only apply once the golden section search method to obtain the optimal TD of first task and directly obtain the optimal offloading solution for any consequently arrived task with different workloads. For the dynamic-channel scenario where the channel qualities from the wireless device to the edge-computing servers are varying, it is critical to quickly determine the current task’s offloading solution under the current channel state and task workload, which is very challenging for the traditional optimization methods. In order to conquer this challenge, we propose the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm, which can obtain the near-optimal offloading solution instantly after enough learning. Finally, we validate through simulations the advantages of NOMA over frequency division multiple access (FDMA).","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3162263","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872322); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:LR20F020003); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)(grant numbers:JP18K18044,JP21K17736); FCT project (Intelligent and Sustainable Aerial-Terrestrial IoT Networks-BATS)(grant numbers:PTDC/EEI-TEL/1744/2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9741761","Multi-access edge computing;computation delay minimization;NOMA;deep reinforcement learning","Task analysis;Delays;Energy consumption;Resource management;NOMA;Wireless communication;Servers","","100","","45","IEEE","25 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, by simultaneously taking into account the difference between each alternative and all the others for the decision maker (DM), the difference of each alternative between the individual DM and the decision group, and the difference of each alternative between the individual DM and all the others, a tri-objective nonlinear programming model is created to determine the DMs' weights. Secondly, to derive the criteria weights, objective positive ideal solution (OPIS), and the objective negative ideal solution (ONIS), a new four-objective DHF mathematical programming model is established by minimizing inconsistency and maximizing consistency based on OPIS and ONIS, and a pair of parametric nonlinear programming models are technically established by unequal weighted summation approach for solving the four-objective DHF mathematical programming model, which can provide DMs with more agility and flexible space to change their preference. Thirdly, by considering the distances of each alternative from the OPIS and ONIS for individual DM and the decision group, a minimizing deviation optimal model is established to derive the group ranking order of alternatives.

In this study, we propose a data fusion strategy to support climate vulnerability assessments by identifying the adaptability of crops in a territory in the short term. This strategy follows the Joint Directors of Laboratories’ data fusion model guidelines. It was evaluated and validated through a case study in Colombia’s upper Cauca river basin. For this purpose, we identified Climate, Soil, Water Quality, Productive Alliances, and Production as the most relevant data sources to be integrated, and using metrics such as Mean IR, SCUMBLE, TCS, among others, we evaluated the combined datasets according to their theoretical complexity. The adaptability of crops in a territory was addressed as a multi-label learning problem, assessing the performance of different multi-label classification and multi-view multi-label classification models with both test and actual data. Comparing the predicted crops with the actual ones, we obtained a 98% similarity without considering crop ranking using the Binary Relevance approach and the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms.

As a solution, fog computing has emerged, placing computational resources closer to the user to lower the communication overhead and congestion in the cloud. In fog computing systems, microservices are deployed as containers, which require an orchestration tool like Kubernetes to support service discovery, placement, and recovery. A key challenge in the orchestration of microservices is automatically scaling the microservices in case of an unpredictable burst of load. In cloud computing, a centralized autoscaler can monitor the deployed microservice instances and make scaling actions based on the monitored metric values. However, monitoring an increasing number of microservices in fog computing can cause excessive network overhead and thereby delay the time to scaling action. We propose DESA, a fully DEcentralized Self-adaptive Autoscaler through which microservice instances make their own scaling decisions, cloning or terminating themselves through self-monitoring. We evaluate DESA in a simulated fog computing environment with different numbers of fog nodes. Furthermore, we conduct a case study with the 1998 World Cup website access log, examining DESA's performance in a realistic scenario. The results show that DESA successfully reduces the scaling reaction time in large-scale fog computing systems compared to the centralized approach. Moreover, DESA resulted in a similar maximum number of instances and lower average CPU utilization during bursts of load.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2261","ITRC(Information Technology Research Center)(grant numbers:IITP-2023-2020-0-01795); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10376422","Web services in edge clouds;microservice autoscaling;service elasticity;container orchestration","Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;Web services;Scalability;Microservice architectures;Cloning;Elasticity","","1","","25","","29 Dec 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

The introduction of Semantic Web technologies aimed to enhance precision and accuracy by converting the web into a structured data format. The Cultural Heritage (CH) community has been at the forefront of adopting Semantic Web practices to promote interoperability and shared understanding. In this study, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework that spans cultural heritage, information modeling, and information retrieval. Our model addresses early solutions in knowledge organization systems, highlighting the evolution from classification systems and controlled vocabularies to the significance of metadata schemas. We delve into the limitations of traditional knowledge organization systems and the necessity of formal ontologies, particularly in the cultural heritage domain. The comparative analysis of CRM vs. EDM, ontology-based metadata interoperability, and ontology technologies elucidate our contributions to the field. This paper outlines the process from the initial steps of adopting Semantic Web technologies in the CH domain to the latest developments in CH information retrieval. In this paper, we also reviewed intelligent applications and services developed in the CH domain after establishing semantic data models and Knowledge Organization Systems. Finally, challenges and possible future research directions are discussed. The findings revealed that GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) are excellent and comprehensive sources of CH information.

In this article, a new model integrating supply chain and IoT, referred to as SCoT, is proposed to evolve into SSCE and thus enhance supply chain productivity. Productivity in this article considers not only the rate of product output but also product quality and the rate of new product development. First, the ubiquitous and ultra-reliable connectivity necessary for connecting all things in SCoT is newly defined. Four fundamental applications in SSCE are identified, and four related use cases are discussed. Seamless information access in the fully connected SCoT network will facilitate supply chain management. A novel universal SCoT platform is thus proposed to perform intelligent operations on quality measurement, product integration, and decision making. Hitherto, there is no universal standard that quantitatively grades all Supply Chain of Things with a single indicator. To ensure the platform's objectiveness and consistency, an emerging IoT standard of IEEE P2668, namely IDex, is incorporated into the platform. IDex provides quantitative measurement, grading, and ranking of all IoT things. In addition, IDex also benefits the platform by contributing three extra functions to advise on a solution for quality improvement, integration guidance, and performance prediction. Ultimately, SCoT will proliferate five key impacts on automated quality control, efficient integration, smart transportation, intelligent decision making, and end-to-end traceability.

However, fine-tuning all the parameters reduces the efficiency of models both in training and inference owing to their increasingly heavy structures. Existing methods for parameter efficiency still require approximately 1 MB of storage and have approximately  $10^{7}$  operations during model deployment and inference. This puts a strain on the storage and processor capacity of end devices such as smartphones and IoT equipment, and slow model inference adversely affecting the user experience. To achieve more efficient and storage-friendly inference compared to mainstream methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and Adapter, LayerConnect (hyper-network-assisted interlayer connectors) is proposed in this paper. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the performance of LayerConnect for two essential tasks with completely different learning frameworks and purposes: natural language understanding (using the general language understanding evaluation (GLUE) benchmark) and information retrieval (using the a contextualized inverted list (COIL) framework). For both tasks, our LayerConnect saves up to 95.31% and 91.18% of parameters in LoRA and Adapter, respectively. In contrast, LayerConnect maintains performance degradation for GLUE and COIL to less than 8% and 3%, compared to LoRA. When compared to Adapter, the numbers become 5% and 3%, for GLUE and COIL, respectively. In addition, LayerConnect required approximately 100 kB of storage per task-specific trained model for both tasks and reduced the number of operations in the model inference by four orders of magnitude, reaching approximately  $10^{3}$ .","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3378518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10474022","Parameter efficiency;model inference;hypernetwork;pretrained language model;green AI","Task analysis;Transformers;Adaptation models;Connectors;Tuning;Information retrieval;Training","","","","33","CCBYNCND","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, given a query node  $q$ , we discover a cohesive subgraph containing  $q$  from a HIN, where all nodes are of the same type as  $q$  and have dense relationships. Yet existing solutions cannot be applied to various HINs, and the result subgraph is not accurate and close enough due to ignoring the connectivity among nodes within the subgraph.

Due to limited resources available on edge devices, multi-task learning (MTL), which accommodates multiple cognitive tasks in one model, is considered a more efficient deployment of HDC. However, as the number of tasks increases, MTL-based HDC (MTL-HDC) suffers from the huge overhead of associative memory (AM) and performance degradation. This hinders MTL-HDC from the practical realization on edge devices. This article aims to establish an MTL framework for HDC to achieve a flexible and efficient trade-off between memory overhead and performance degradation. For the shared-AM approach, we propose Dimension Ranking for Effective AM Sharing (DREAMS) to effectively merge multiple AMs while preserving as much information of each task as possible. For the independent-AM approach, we propose Dimension Ranking for Independent MEmory Retrieval (DRIMER) to extract and concatenate informative components of AMs while mitigating interferences among tasks. By leveraging both mechanisms, we propose a hybrid framework of Multi-Tasking HDC, called MulTa-HDC. To adapt an MTL-HDC system to an edge device given a memory resource budget, MulTa-HDC utilizes three parameters to flexibly adjust the proportion of the shared AM and independent AMs. The proposed MulTa-HDC is widely evaluated across three common benchmarks under two standard task protocols. The simulation results of ISOLET, UCIHAR, and MNIST datasets demonstrate that the proposed MulTa-HDC outperforms other state-of-the-art compressed HD models, including SparseHD and CompHD, by up to 8.23% in terms of classification accuracy.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2021.3073409","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 109-2221-E-002-175); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405468","Brain-inspired computing;hyperdimensional computing;machine learning;multi-task learning","Task analysis;Training;Degradation;Internet of Things;Interference;Memory management;Computational modeling","","5","","38","IEEE","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The emergence of amalgamated blockchain-based internet-of-things (IoT) systems has generated a huge amount of data to be online. Though blockchains show potential for ensuring transparency, traceability, and immutable records, the privacy of online data in blockchains becomes a question. The privacy of blockchain transactions is at stake as various privacy breaching methods are used by attackers such as linking the transactions, deanonymization, etc. However, the benefits of blockchain make the technology a dominator in the present and future technological paradigms. The other side of the coin deals with privacy information retrieval (PIR), which is necessary to retrieve private information from servers without much revealing. However, the conjunction of blockchain privacy and PIR is very critical and an important aspect of blockchain solutions. In this present survey, we pioneer in analyzing the privacy factors of existing blockchain solutions. We discuss the privacy parameters and important privacy enhancement techniques for blockchains comprehensively. We show the applicability of privacy in various domains including e-commerce, supply chain, healthcare, and IoT. We also discuss PIR-related issues and solutions in the existing literature.

To solve this challenge, we propose a Priori Knowledge Based Service Composition (PKBSC) approach to reduce the searching space of relevant service discovery so as to improve the efficiency of service composition. PKBSC utilizes an interoperable approach, including an ontology construction and merging method, to solve the problem of the cross-domain and heterogeneous services from different repositories. In addition, service pattern is adopted to describe priori knowledge from massive historical solutions, which is a recurrent valuable fragment composed of services frequently invoked together in service solutions. PKBSC also adopts the Formal Concept Analysis to extract the implicit relationship between service requests and service patterns. Compared with the approach of composing multiple services from scratch, PKBSC exhibits better performance since the search space is greatly reduced by the adoption of service patterns.

Specifically, there are K messages replicatively stored at N databases. A user wants to retrieve one message by communicating with the databases, without revealing the identity of the message retrieved. For T-colluding databases, any T out of N databases may communicate their interactions with the user to guess the identity of the requested message. We consider the situation where the communication system can be vulnerable to attachers, namely, there is an adversary in the system that can tap in on or even try to corrupt the communication. The capacity is defined as the maximum number of information bits of the desired message retrieved per downloaded bit. For SPIR, it is further required that the user learns nothing about the other K - 1 messages in the database. Three types of adversaries are considered: a Byzantine adversary who can overwrite the transmission of any B servers to the user; a passive eavesdropper who can tap in on the incoming and outgoing transmissions of any E servers; and a combination of both -an adversary who can tap in on a set of any E nodes, and overwrite the transmission of a set of any B nodes. The problems of SPIR with colluding servers and the three types of adversaries are named T-BSPIR, T-ESPIR and T-BESPIR, respectively. We derive the capacities of the three secure SPIR problems. The results resemble those of secure network coding problems with adversaries and eavesdroppers. The capacity of T-colluding PIR with Byzantine adversaries is characterized in [1]. In this work, we consider T-colluding PIR with an eavedropper (named T-EPIR). We derive the T-EPIR capacity when E ≥ T; for the case where E ≤ T, we find an outer bound (converse bound) and an inner bound (achievability) on the optimal achievable rate.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2018.2878034","Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509632","Private information retrieval;colluding servers;eavesdropper;Byzantine adversary","Servers;Indexes;Information retrieval;Data privacy;Network coding;Random variables","","36","","23","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such an explosion has posed a great challenge for a centralized pattern of computing, storing, and managing information, calling for a more decentralized (cloud-based) style of processing data for vehicular social network. Decentralized information processing requires encryption of sensitive information prior to out-sourcing for the purpose of protecting data from unsolicited access and thus a searchable keyword index needs to be extracted from the encrypted document for solicited access. However, most existing searchable encryption schemes, based on the words in the subject or content, suffers from poor retrieval performance. In this study, a novel keyword extraction metric based on spatial distribution of a particular text is proposed with the view to improving the retrieval performance. In the proposed solution, constrained information retrieval in vehicle social network is conceptualized as retrieval of data with extremely strict security and privacy preserving policies and a cloud-based vehicle social information retrieval framework is developed. In line with the framework, experiments have been conducted on benchmark data sets and diverse evaluation metrics.

In the problem of distributed estimation, a set of nodes estimate some parameter from noisy measurements. To leverage joint effort, the nodes communicate with each other in the estimation process. The communications consume bandwidth and energy resources, and these resources are often limited in real-world applications. To cope with the resources constraints, the event-triggered mechanism is proposed and widely adopted. It only allows signals to be transmitted if they carry significant amount of information. Various criteria of determining whether the information is significant lead to different trigger rules. With these rules, the resources can be saved. However, in the meanwhile, some inter-event information, not that important but still of certain use, is unavailable to the neighbors. The absence of these inter-event information may affect the algorithm performance. Considering this, in this paper, we come up with an inter-event information retrieval scheme to recover certain untransmitted information, which is the first work doing so to the best of our knowledge. We design an approach for inter-event information retrieval, and formulate and solve an optimization problem which has a closed-form solution to acquire information.

The two algorithms consider the large scale and the time-varying nature of the SIoT, respectively. Unlike the existing works, the static method is inspired by the first-connection-last-expansion idea. Top-k neighbors of each query node are first found by a random walk. Then, all the query nodes and their top-k neighbors are connected as the core using Steiner tree expansion. The rank constraint random sampling is utilized to extend the core to a dense subgraph. Further, by leveraging a graph kernel index and identifying the updates that may affect the results, we conduct the dynamic query in an incremental update way instead of executing it from scratch.

Traditional approaches based on the self-description documents for services usually utilize service signatures. In Web service composition, service clustering can also be performed by the invocation relationship between services. Therefore, based on the successful development of several embedding techniques for words in several contexts, a novel deep learning-based service embedding using invocation sequences is devised for service clustering. Moreover, many microservices are being created because of the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge, and fog computing. Following these developments, Web service composition based on these environments has emerged in abundance. More efficient lightweight approaches to analyze large numbers of services are necessary for service clustering. Consequently, a lightweight deep learning-based approach for the semantic clustering of service composition is presented to address these requirements. In this paper, we first propose the concept of service embedding to capture semantic information from invocation sequences. Second, we suggest using state-of-the-art neural language sequence models for service embedding and develop a corresponding lightweight Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT)-based model. Next, combined with K-means clustering, the semantic clustering of service composition is evaluated. Finally, the experimental results show that the clustering process can be effectively performed by the lightweight BERT-based model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389549","Semantic service clustering;service embedding;composition;lightweight BERT","Web services;Semantics;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Ontologies;Deep learning;Data mining","","7","","46","CCBY","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The adverse consequences of stroke have led to global interest and work for improving the management and diagnosis of stroke. Various techniques for data mining have been used globally for accurate prediction of occurrence of stroke based on the risk factors that are associated with the electronic health care records (EHRs) of the patients. In particular, EHRs routinely contain several thousands of features and most of them are redundant and irrelevant that need to be discarded to enhance the prediction accuracy. The choice of feature-selection methods can help in improving the prediction accuracy of the model and efficient data management of the archived input features. In this paper, we systematically analyze the various features in EHR records for the detection of stroke. We propose a novel rough-set based technique for ranking the importance of the various EHR records in detecting stroke. Unlike the conventional rough-set techniques, our proposed technique can be applied on any dataset that comprises binary feature sets. stroke. We evaluated our proposed method in a publicly available dataset of EHR, and concluded that age, average glucose level, heart disease, and hypertension were the most essential attributes for detecting stroke in patients.

In previous FSSL systems, a single global model is always trained without an equivalent generalization ability for the clients under the non-IID setting. Accordingly, model personalization methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. Intuitively, seeking labeling assistance from other clients with similar data distribution, i.e., model migration, can effectively improve the personalization on the clients with scarce labeled data. However, previous works require to migrate a pre-fixed number of models among the clients, causing unnecessary resource waste and accuracy degradation due to resource heterogeneity. Considering that the number of model migrations and the quality of pseudo-labels have a significant impact on the training performance (e.g., efficiency and accuracy), we propose a novel personalized FSSL system, called Ferrari, to boost the efficiency of pseudo-labeling and training accuracy through adaptive model migrations among the clients. Specifically, Ferrari first generates the similarity-based ranking using a Gaussian KD-Tree, considering the varied data distributions among the clients. Combined with the ranking and clients' heterogeneous resource constraints, Ferrari then adaptively determines the proper model migration policy and confidence thresholds for high-quality pseudo-labeling and personalized training for clients. Extensive experiments on a physical platform show that Ferrari provides a 1.2$\sim 5.5\times$ speedup without sacrificing model accuracy, compared to existing methods.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2024.3370961","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61936015,62132019); Jiangsu Province Science Foundation for Youths(grant numbers:BK20230275); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10452758","Federated Semi-Supervised Learning;Personalization;Model Migration;Edge Computing","Data models;Adaptation models;Training;Computational modeling;Costs;Mobile computing;Servers","","1","","","IEEE","28 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To avoid the bottleneck on the PS, Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), which utilizes peer-to-peer (P2P) communication without maintaining a global model, has been proposed. Nevertheless, DFL still faces two critical challenges, i.e., limited communication bandwidth and not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) local data, thus hindering efficient model training. Existing works commonly assume full model aggregation at periodic intervals, i.e., clients periodically collect models from peers. To reduce the communication cost, these methods allow clients to collect model(s) from selected peers, but often result in a significant degradation of model accuracy when dealing with non-IID data. Alternatively, the layer-wise aggregation mechanism has been proposed to alleviate communication overhead under the PS architecture, but its potential in DFL remains rarely explored yet. To this end, we propose an efficient DFL framework YOGA that adaptively performs layer-wise model aggregation and training. Specifically, YOGA first generates the ranking of layers in the model according to the learning speed and layer-wise divergence. Combining with the layer ranking and peers’ status information (i.e., data distribution and communication capability), we propose the max-match (MM) algorithm to generate the proper layer-wise model aggregation policy for the clients. Extensive experiments on DNN models and datasets show that YOGA saves communication cost by about 45% without sacrificing the model performance compared with the baselines, and provides 1.53- $3.5\times $  speedup on the physical platform.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2023.3329005","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3301501); National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61936015); Jiangsu Province Science Foundation for Youths(grant numbers:BK20210122,BK20230275); Xiaomi Young Talents Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10309973","Decentralized federated learning;edge computing;heterogeneity;layer-wise aggregation","Adaptation models;Training;Data models;Convergence;Peer-to-peer computing;Federated learning;Artificial neural networks","","1","","51","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the substantial amount of private information stored on these devices, the security of mobile devices has emerged as a significant concern for users. Different from conventional methods such as PINs, fingerprints, and face IDs, which authenticate users only during the initial login stage, continuous authentication ensures consistent verification while mobile devices are in use. Current continuous authentication methods require extensive data from a series of users for effective training. Nevertheless, it is challenging to collect sufficient amount of data within a limited time. In this paper, we propose CALL, an unsupervised sensor-based Continuous Authentication system with a Low-rank transformer using Learning-to-rank algorithms. The lightweight CALL is capable of providing both spatial and temporal features for end-to-end authentication. Specifically, CALL utilizes time series data from a legitimate user, collected by the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors on smartphones, to train a pure one-dimensional autoencoder for spatial features and a shuffle low-rank Transformer (SLRT) for temporal features in the training phase. In the authentication phase, the trained pure one-dimensional autoencoder captures spatial features by reconstructing input data to obtain the reconstruction error, and SLRT captures temporal features by predicting a ranking vector that reveals the order of the shuffled feature sequence. The predicted ranking vector is then used to recover the shuffled sequence and the similarity between the frequency spectrum sequences of the recovered sequence and the original time series data is calculated. The reconstruction error and similarity are compared against pre-defined thresholds, and CALL authenticates a user as legitimate only if both values fall below their respective thresholds. Finally, we evaluate the performance of CALL on UCI_HAR, WISDM_HARB, and our dataset, and the extensive experiments illustrate that CALL reaches the best performance with 96.43%, 95.24% and 96.92% accuracy, and 4.28%, 4.76% and 3.86% EERs on the three datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art continuous authentication methods.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2024.3353209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398510","Continuous authentication;learning-to-rank algorithms;low-rank transformer;spatial features;temporal features","Authentication;Feature extraction;Training;Transformers;Data models;Behavioral sciences;Time series analysis","","","","","IEEE","12 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To address this limitation of CoAP, in this letter, we propose the two mobility management schemes based on the proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6): CoAP-PMIP and CoAP-DPMIP. In CoAP-PMIP, local mobility anchor (LMA) and mobile access gateways (MAGs) are used to provide network-based mobility support for sensor devices. Each device has to register its IPv6 address with LMA, and all messages are transmitted through LMA. In CoAP-DPMIP, the role of LMA is distributed to each MAG. By using distributed MAGs, this scheme can provide optimized transmission path and also reduce the handover delay. From ns-3 simulations, we can see that the CoAP-DPMIP scheme provides better performance than the CoAP and CoAP-PMIP schemes, in terms of total delay associated with binding update, data transmission, and handover.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2601318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547316","Mobility management;PMIPv6;CoAP;mobile sensor devices;handover;internet of things","Handover;Delays;Internet of things;Mobile radio mobility management;Performance evaluation","","21","","9","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider a basic Point-to-Point (P2P) setup and develop a unified analytical framework for the asymptotic symbol error rate (SER) performance of the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder with  $M$ -ary amplitude-shift keying (ASK). The developed framework is general and can be applied for a large class of fading channels. The SER can be characterized by two parameters: the diversity order and the coding gain at a sufficiently high signal-to-noise regime. We derive closed-form expressions for the exact diversity order along with a lower and upper bound on the coding gain. We show that the diversity order is equal to  $m$  for Nakagami- $m$  fading, whereas for the other considered models, it is equal to one. We also prove that among all possible binary modulations with equal power, the modulation with one symbol equal to zero [i.e., on–off keying (OOK)] achieves the minimum asymptotic SER. The mathematical framework developed for the P2P setup is extended for cooperative relay networks. Specifically, we consider a basic amplify-and-forward (AF) three-node relay topology that employs AD at both the relay and the destination.

Network pruning can effectively alleviate the excessive parameters and computation issues in CNNs. However, fine-grained pruning is not hardware friendly, while other structured pruning schemes will result in a much higher loss of accuracy under the same compression ratio.

Structural rotor fault (SRF) is the most vital but least attended defect, which is the root cause of most RM issues.

Moreover, a DFC-based ranking and image combining scheme is proposed to select the most informative sensor signals from the segmented raw vibration signals and generate a 3D-FRP, and 2D flattened FRP (F-FRP). These multi-sensor FRPs characterize the system dynamics and preserve the time-series properties of the vibration input. The DFC stream simultaneously catered to LSTM facilitates symptom parameters-based decision-making.

Instead of relying only on fixed infrastructures as the cloud, users’ devices act as service providers for each other. They use pairwise contacts to collect information about services provided and amount of time to provide them by the encountered nodes. At each node, upon generation of a service request, this information is used to choose the most efficient service, or composition of services, that satisfy that request, based on local knowledge. Opportunistic computing can be exploited in several scenarios, including mobile social networks, IoT, and Internet 4.0. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic computing algorithm based on an analytical model, which ranks the available (composition of) services, based on their expected completion time. Through the model, a service requester picks the one that is expected to be the best.

However, GANs face several issues in image-to-image translation, including training instability, lack of diversity, and mode collapse. These issues become even more complex when using cyclic GANs. Additionally, collecting paired images required for GANs may be costly, especially in the medical domain. Cyclic GANs are a favorable choice for addressing this issue, as they can convert cross-domain images. However, no pre-existing technique or algorithm is comprehensive enough to handle diverse datasets and applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel Quantized Evolutionary Gradient Aware Multiobjective Cyclic GAN (QEMCGAN) that employs evolutionary computation, multiobjective optimization, and an intelligent selection scheme. We use simulated annealing and Pareto ranking selection using three fitness criteria to address local optima stagnation. Additionally, we use model quantization because of its suitability for low-cost IoT-based applications. Extensive trials reveal that EMCGAN and QEMCGAN produces more visually realistic images than other approaches while preserving both background information and salient features. In addition, QEMCGAN performs on par with the baseline approach even when the model size is halved, making it more efficient.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3263434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091835","Multiobjective optimization;cyclic GAN;unpaired image translation;medical images;quantization","Generative adversarial networks;Training;Optimization;Computational modeling;Generators;Task analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging","Humans;Algorithms;Exercise;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","3","","31","IEEE","4 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, malicious platforms may provide untrusted data or illegally leak users’ information, which leads users in crowdsensing networks to be reluctant to participate in sensing activities. Besides, users are unwilling to report malicious platforms without sufficient incentives. To tackle the problem, a new incentive mechanism is proposed by modeling users’ preferences in this paper. Specifically, two scenarios are considered to detect malicious platforms when users join sensing activities according to the system grasps user’s information, i.e., complete information scenario and partial information scenario. Different incentive algorithms are designed for each scenario to optimize the systems incentive cost. In the complete information scenario, we minimize the total incentive cost by ranking users’ preferences. In the partial information scenario, uniform Distribution and Laplace Distribution are employed to model the distribution of users’ preferences to find the optimal cost. Specifically, we incorporate the concept of non-convexity into design the incentive mechanism, when user preferences obey the Laplace Distribution. By conducting an in-depth exploration the properties of Laplace Distribution, we can transform it into a convex problem to solve it efficiently. The analysis based on these mechanisms lays a theoretical foundation on the detection of malicious platforms. Furthermore, the soundness of modeling and the accuracy of analysis are verified through extensive simulation, which also guides the design of more sophisticated incentive schemes for the detection of malicious platforms.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2024.3352412","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSF China)(grant numbers:U22B2025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387463","Mobile crowdsensing;malicious platforms;incentive mechanism;uniform distribution;Laplace distribution","Sensors;Task analysis;Costs;Crowdsensing;Computational modeling;Security;Numerical models","","","","40","IEEE","10 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, SIoT has become a promising network for service discovery and composition. By introducing SIoT, we can expand the traditional mobile crowdsourcing network and achieve broader crowdsourcing application. However, some threats are also raised in SIoT environments. In order to handle these challenges, we first present a trustworthy crowdsourcing model in SIoT. In this model, social cloud provides compute and storage functions, and works as a service provider to bridge end users and sensing entities; sensing entities receive tasks and rewards from a service provider and feed back data. Then the concept of social awareness is introduced to message forwarding among objects in SIoT, providing social data links.

For the deployment of CR solutions, it is important to implement proper sensing procedures, which are aimed at continuously surveying the status of the channels. However, accurate views of the resources status can be achieved only through the cooperation of many sensing devices. For these reasons, in this paper, we propose the utilization of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm, according to which objects are capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way, with respect to the rules set by their owners. The resulting social network enables faster and trustworthy information/service discovery exploiting the social network of “friend” objects.

However, with the constant launch of new cloud services and capabilities almost every month by both big (e.g., Amazon Web Service and Microsoft Azure) and small companies (e.g., Rackspace and Ninefold), decision makers (e.g., application developers and chief information officers) are likely to be overwhelmed by choices available. The decision-making problem is further complicated due to heterogeneous service configurations and application provisioning QoS constraints. To address this hard challenge, in our previous work, we developed a semiautomated, extensible, and ontology-based approach to infrastructure service discovery and selection only based on design-time constraints (e.g., the renting cost, the data center location, the service feature, etc.). In this paper, we extend our approach to include the real-time (run-time) QoS (the end-to-end message latency and the end-to-end message throughput) in the decision-making process. The hosting of next-generation applications in the domain of online interactive gaming, large-scale sensor analytics, and real-time mobile applications on cloud services necessitates the optimization of such real-time QoS constraints for meeting service-level agreements. To this end, we present a real-time QoS-aware multicriteria decision-making technique that builds over the well-known analytic hierarchy process method. The proposed technique is applicable to selecting Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud offers, and it allows users to define multiple design-time and real-time QoS constraints or requirements. These requirements are then matched against our knowledge base to compute the possible best fit combinations of cloud services at the IaaS layer.

In this paper, we propose a novel Web services similarity measure approach based on the notion of service composition context. Specifically, we first introduce three types of parameter correlations between service input and output parameters. These correlations can be obtained from existing services compositions. Based on parameter correlations, we propose the service composition context model. Through the composition context of a service, the composition context network is constructed using contexts of all services. Then, we propose to measure the similarity between any two services using the PersonalRank and SimRank++ algorithms by taking the obtained context network as input. By experiments, we analyze the characteristics of our proposed method and demonstrate that its accuracy is much better than the state-of-the-art approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915371","Humanities and Social Science Research Project of the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:19YJCZH240,18YJAZH017); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472229,31671588); Science and Technology Development Fund of Shandong Province of China(grant numbers:2016ZDJS02A11,ZR2017MF027); Taishan Scholar Climbing Program of Shandong Province; SDUST Research Fund(grant numbers:2015TDJH102); Shandong University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2014RCJJ049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8708213","Web services;parameter correlation;composition context;services similarity","Web services;Correlation;Semantics;Context modeling;Syntactics;STEM;Ontologies","","6","","45","OAPA","7 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Being data-driven entities that process a variety of data in real-time, DTs can be hosted at the network edge, thus providing low latency services. However, the deployment of a networking architecture supporting the dynamic discovery of DTs and their instantiation at the edge is still an open challenge. To fill the gap, in this article we conceive a solution that leverages two revolutionary paradigms, namely the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) and Information Centric Networking (ICN). On the one hand, SIoT can provide trustworthy interactions between DTs to support effective service discovery and composition. On the other hand, ICN is a network model that includes data-centric primitives and in-network caching to facilitate service provisioning. By combining the two paradigms, we create a new framework where DT services are requested by name and discovered in a timely fashion by navigating a name-based SIoT network. Whenever possible, services already instantiated at the edge are reused to satisfy different clients. After demonstrating the benefits of the envisioned framework with a preliminary evaluation, we highlight research opportunities for this timely topic.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.002.2300102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10299628","","Social Internet of Things;6G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Social networking (online);Object recognition;Navigation;Digital twins","","1","","15","IEEE","30 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The relevant elements in the problem are divided into multiple logical levels and processed layer by layer. The entire service process is represented through a directed graph, and specific business is represented using a vertex set. A forward step re-planning rule is established to skip business vertices. The experimental results showed that the research method had an error of only 0.071% in solving quality analysis at 20 business vertices, which was lower compared with other methods. In the multi concurrency tolerance test, the research method only experienced 5 crashes during a 500s runtime. In the analysis of packet loss rate during operation, when there was no network fluctuation, the packet loss rate of the research method fluctuated between 0.1% and 0.7%.

We propose the cybersecurity body of knowledge (CYBOK), which takes in sufficiently characteristic models of systems and acts as a search engine for potential attack vectors. CYBOK is fundamentally an algorithmic approach to vulnerability exploration, which is a significant extension to the body of knowledge it builds upon. By using CYBOK, security analysts and system designers can work together to assess the overall security posture of systems early in their lifecycle, during major design decisions and before final product designs, consequently, assisting in applying security earlier and throughout the systems lifecycle.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2940145","Center for Complex Systems and Enterprises at the Stevens Institute of Technology; United States Department of Defense through the Systems Engineering Research Center; University Affiliated Research Center managed by Stevens Institute of Technology(grant numbers:HQ0034-13-D-0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8850328","Cyber-physical systems;model-based engineer-ing;safety;security","Analytical models;Data models;Software;Cyber-physical systems;Computer security;Safety","","16","","39","IEEE","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Radio sensing here refers to information retrieval from received mobile signals for objects of interest in the environment surrounding the radio transceivers, and it may go beyond the functions of localization, tracking, and object recognition of traditional radar. In PMNs, JCAS integrates sensing into communications, sharing a majority of system modules and the same transmitted signals. The PMN is expected to provide a ubiquitous radio sensing platform and enable a vast number of novel smart applications, whilst providing non-compromised communications. In this paper, we present a broad picture of the motivation, methodologies, challenges, and research opportunities of realizing PMN, by providing a comprehensive survey for systems and technologies developed mainly in the last ten years. Beginning by reviewing the work on coexisting communication and radar systems, we highlight their limits on addressing the interference problem, and then introduce the JCAS technology. We then set up JCAS in the mobile network context and envisage its potential applications. We continue to provide a brief review of three types of JCAS systems, with particular attention to their differences in design philosophy. We then introduce a framework of PMN, including the system platform and infrastructure, three types of sensing operations, and signals usable for sensing. Subsequently, we discuss required system modifications to enable sensing on current communication-only infrastructure. Within the context of PMN, we review stimulating research problems and potential solutions, organized under nine topics: performance bounds, waveform optimization, antenna array design, clutter suppression, sensing parameter estimation, resolution of sensing ambiguity, pattern analysis, networked sensing under cellular topology, and sensing-assisted communications.

The much wider channel bandwidth of NR, compared to LTE, enables more efficient use of resources than the existing carrier aggregation framework with lower control overhead. The support of multiple sub-carrier spacing options allows NR to operate in a wide range of carrier frequency from sub-6 GHz band to mmWave band with appropriate handling of multi-path delay spread and phase noise depending on the carrier frequency. In addition, the introduction of the new bandwidth part concept allows flexible and dynamic configuration of UE's operating bandwidth, which will make NR an energy-efficient solution despite the support of wide bandwidth.

To tackle these concerns, we propose a blockchain-based smart parking system with privacy preservation and reputation management. In our system, a consortium blockchain is created by different parking lots to run the parking system securely and transparently, where the parking offers are recorded on a shared and immutable ledger. We use a commitment technique during the submission of the offers to ensure fair parking rates. Then, we use a private information retrieval technique during the offers retrieval to preserve the drivers' location privacy. Furthermore, to anonymously and efficiently authenticate drivers during the reservation process, we use a short randomizable signature. We also use a time-locked anonymous payment technique to discourage drivers from not committing to their parking reservations and provide a secure and privacy-preserving payment method for parking service. Finally, we integrate a blockchain-based anonymous reputation management scheme into our system, where drivers can anonymously rate the parking service to ensure high quality of service.

This, in turn, poses a number of challenges with respect to big data storage across multiple locations, including cloud computing platform. For example, the underlying distributed file system has a large number of directories and files in the form of gigantic trees, which are difficult to parse in polynomial time. Moreover, with the exponential increase of big data streams (i.e., unbounded sets of continuous data flows), challenges associated with indexing and membership queries are compounded. The capability to process such significant amount of data with high accuracy can have significant impact on decision-making and formulation of business and risk-related strategies, particularly in our current Industrial Internet of Things environment (IIoT). However, existing storage solutions are deterministic in nature. In other words, they tend to consume considerable memory and CPU time to yield accurate results. This necessitates the design of efficient quality of service-aware IIoT applications that are able to deal with the challenges of data storage and retrieval in the cloud computing environment. In this paper, we present an effective space-effective strategy for massive data storage using bloom filter (BF). Specifically, in the proposed scheme, the standard BF is extended to incorporate fuzzy-enabled folding approach, hereafter referred to as fuzzy folded BF (FFBF). In FFBF, fuzzy operations are used to accommodate the hashed data of one BF into another to reduce storage requirements. Evaluations on UCI ML AReM and Facebook datasets demonstrate the efficacy of FFBF, in terms of dealing with approximately 1.9 times more data as compared to using the standard BF. This is also achieved without affecting the false positive rate and query time.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2018.2850053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8395004","Big data storage;bloom filter (BF);cloud storage;double hashing;probabilistic data structures (PDS)","Cloud computing;Memory;Big Data;Sensors;Complexity theory;Internet of Things;Distributed databases","","41","","26","IEEE","25 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To date, there are several privacy-enhancing techniques, such as secure multiparty computation techniques, private information retrieval (PIR), and data sanitization techniques. However, there is not a single technique that works for all possible uses of the data in edge systems. In addition, these techniques are computationally expensive and thus may not be suitable for edge devices. In this paper, we first cover basic privacy building blocks, including differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. We then discuss privacy solutions specific to three different types of data use that are relevant for edge-based applications: data aggregation techniques, point-of-interest (POI) services and traffic information services, and crowdsourcing.

Video captured by surveillance cameras in real-time often contains identifiable personal information, which must be privacy protected, sometimes along with the locations of the surveillance and other sensitive information. Within the Surveillance System, these videos are processed and stored on a variety of devices. The processing and storage heterogeneity of those devices, together with their network requirements, make real-time surveillance systems complex and challenging. This paper proposes a surveillance system, named as Multi-Level Video Security (MuLViS) for privacy-protected cameras. Firstly, a Smart Surveillance Security Ontology (SSSO) is integrated within the MuLViS, with the aim of autonomously selecting the privacy level matching the operating device's hardware specifications and network capabilities. Overall, along with its device-specific security, the system leads to relatively fast indexing and retrieval of surveillance video. Secondly, information within the videos are protected at the times of capturing, streaming, and storage by means of differing encryption levels. An extensive evaluation of the system, through visual inspection and statistical analysis of experimental video results, such as by the Encryption Space Ratio (ESR), has demonstrated the aptness of the security level assignments. The system is suitable for surveillance footage protection, which can be made General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant, ensuring that lawful data access respects individuals' privacy rights.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024926","Marie Sklodowska-Curie (MSC) Career-FIT Postdoctoral Fellowship(grant numbers:MF 2018-0179); European Union’s Horizon2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the MSC(grant numbers:713654); Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(grant numbers:SFI 16/RC/3918); European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9199837","GDPR;ontology;partial encryption;privacy protection;video surveillance;surveillance cameras;encryption;visual surveillance data","Videos;Surveillance;Encryption;Privacy;Data privacy;Real-time systems","","22","","89","CCBY","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we address the security concerns of cloud storage under the scenario where users encrypt-then-outsource data, share their outsourced data with other users, and the service provider can be queried for searching and retrieval of encrypted data. As main distinctive, we propose a security approach for storage, sharing and retrieval of encrypted data in the cloud fully constructed on the basis of attribute-based encryption (ABE) thus enabling access control mechanisms over both the encrypted data and also for the information retrieval task through search access control. Compared to related works, our approach considers efficient encryption at three different levels: i) bulk encryption of data outsourced to the cloud, ii) keys management for access control over encrypted data by means of digital envelopes from attribute based encryption, and iii) novel construction for attribute based searchable encryption (ABSE). Our underlying ABE algorithms are carefully selected from the body of knowledge and novel constructions for ABSE are provided over the asymmetric setting (Type-III pairings) to support security levels of 128-bits or greater.

As an important means of information retrieval, the research and application of multi-label classification technology in social Internet of Things environment is relatively few. Characterized by multi-labels cognitive learning, fast response, concept drifting and huge solution space, the multi-label learning becomes more complicated under data stream environment. To overcome the problems above, this paper proposed a multi-label algorithm based on kernel extreme learning machine. In the training phase, both Cholesky matrix decomposition inverse method and matrix block method were deployed on the Spark platform to solve the inverse problem of large matrix, thus improving the modeling efficiency. In addition, incremental learning of the model was realized from the two aspects of example increment and class increment. The online sequential extreme learning machine is improved to adjust the network weights and realize incremental updating of input dimension. Meanwhile, the output layer nodes were divided and assembled in the way of “concept group,” which made the single classifier model structure scalable. And the label incremental learning is realized in the output dimension.

Among those services, the discrete Fréchet distance (DFD) range query, which aims to obtain a set of trajectories whose distances to a given query trajectory do not exceed a given threshold, has been widely applied to support applications such as vehicle trajectory clustering and other data processing tasks. Meanwhile, due to the huge data volume issue in the Big Data era, there is a trend towards outsourcing various query services to the cloud for achieving a better performance. However, since the cloud is not fully trustable, designing privacy-preserving query services becomes a research focus. Over the past years, many schemes focusing on privacy-preserving trajectory analysis have been proposed, but none of them can well support privacy-preserving DFD range queries. Aiming at addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving DFD range query scheme, in which queries are conducted in a filtration-and-verification manner and the privacy of the dataset and queries can be preserved. Specifically, by indexing the dataset with two R-trees, a query can be conducted by i) querying the two R-trees to obtain a candidate set and ii) verifying each trajectory in the set, which involve two basic operations, namely, rectangle intersection detection and proximity detection. To preserve the privacy of the dataset and queries, we build the two basic operations upon a novel Inner-Product Preserving Encryption (IPPE) scheme, which is proved to be selectively secure with trivial leakages. Besides, extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce the computational cost by effectively reducing the candidate set’s size.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3171980","NSERC(grant numbers:04009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9767631","Trajectory similarity;discrete Fréchet distance;range query;privacy-preserving;outsourced encrypted data","Trajectory;Servers;Data privacy;Data models;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Internet of Things","","4","","29","IEEE","3 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nowadays, it has more demand to build autonomous and electrical vehicles with information retrieval systems within the received sensory data not only from the local sensors but also the online and live streaming data over networks. To increase road safety dissemination of critical information, including the possibility of an obstacle or danger being in the middle of the road, automotive navigation and control systems are required. A novel method is proposed to make this critical communication possible over a specially designed vehicular ad-hoc network, where natural or urban barriers can prevent signal propagation. The network is implemented using the LoRaWAN interface and SX127x LoRa Radio module. The SX1272MB2xAS is fitted with the SX1272 transceiver, which added to a high-performance FSK/OOK RF transceiver modem. Additionally, LoRa long-range modem provides highly power-efficient communication. For this aim, two new mechanisms have been proposed. The first mechanism enables the nodes to receive data from a suggested communication link. While the second mechanism is designed to extract vital information such as establishing the connection, closing the connection, successful data transmission, errors, etc. The findings demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms have successfully enabled LoRaWAN to operate in IoV environment. The evaluation reveals that metrics such as battery consumption and covering range outperform similar technologies. Finally, this paper proposes a message-passing strategy based on Belief Propagation (BP) which provides more accurate marginal probabilities to overcome the low data rate as a foundation for our future work.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3246471","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)](grant numbers:2022R1A2C1003549); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10048786","Internet of vehicles (IoV);LoRaline;LoRaWAN;vehicular ad-hoc networks;message propagation;anomaly mapping","Protocols;Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Automobiles;Decision making;Message passing;Road safety","","4","","31","CCBYNCND","20 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposed a novel high-performance data structure for multi-query processing based on a lightweight blockchain, namely Multi-State Merkle Patricia Trie (MSMPT). MSMPT combines Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) based indexing and linked-list storage to achieve high performance. MPT has been used on the Ethereum network with a Key-Value database approach. The key field in this proposal is used as crucial user data. The value field is changed to the head of the linked list, and the following data elements will store a summary of the data based on the specified category. In this paper, a blockchain simulator was built to discover the performance of the proposed systems. This simulator will simulate creating blocks in a blockchain network using existing and modified blockchain data structures. The blocks created will be compared using the query process from the conventional and proposed systems. The experimental findings demonstrate that MSMPT outperforms existing blockchain-based data structures by requiring only about one millisecond in query processing performance and less than 500 bytes of additional storage.

Moreover, these privacy-preserving techniques may inadvertently obscure dishonest or malicious behaviors, leading to compromised Quality of Service (QoS). Motivated by this, we propose a Quality-enabled Bilateral Location Privacy-Preserving (Q-BLPP) service construction scheme, ensuring Bilateral LPP without TTP, while maintaining QoS. To achieve bilateral LPP, we introduce a novel BI-LBE algorithm using Bloom Indexing (BI) and Location-Based Encryption (LBE). Additionally, for high-quality recruitment, we present a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) approach to balance exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, to ensure privacy during recruitment, worker profiles are anonymized using differential privacy. To our knowledge, our approach is the first to integrate QoS and LPP in MCS, with theoretical proofs of truthfulness and individual rationality.

In this paper, we present the results of an ongoing investigation into the use of audio-based features for Android malware detection. In addition to extracting new audio-based features, this research aims to find the most discriminative subset of audio-based features through a comparative evaluation of Wrapper-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms on two separate datasets. First, we sonified the Android APK datasets, then extracted 191 static audio-based features from the resultant audio datasets. Fourteen different nature-inspired Wrapper-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms were evaluated for feature selection, and the selected features were then used to train the light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM) classification model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits high discriminative capabilities that can outperform other state-of-the-art techniques.

Then, a pivot-based k-d tree is designed for indexing the dataset and processing the set similarity query. After that, we design homomorphic encryption based privacy-preserving filter/refinement protocols, respectively named as PPF and PPR, to protect set similarity query privacy, and propose our EPSet scheme. The security of our scheme is proved under the simulation-based real/ideal model, and the performance is validated thorugh the extensive experiment evaluation.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2024.3376203","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62302374,U22B2030,62272413); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M722498); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2023-JC-QN-0646); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10470435","Set similarity range query;jaccard similarity;cloud computing;k-d tree;triangle inequality","Servers;Vectors;Privacy;Internet of Things;Homomorphic encryption;Data privacy;Transforms","","","","35","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we study the diversified recommendation problem based on a real-world dataset, represented as a tensor with three dimensions of user, location and activity. As the tensor is rather sparse, we employ tensor decomposition to predict missing values. Additionally, we directly regard recommendation precision as an objective. In addition to precision, we also consider the recommendation novelty and coverage, providing a more comprehensive view of the recommender system. Thus, visitors can discover attractive spots that are less visited in a personalized manner, relieving traffic pressure at famous scenic spots and balancing overall transportation. By integrating all these objectives, we construct a many-objective recommendation model.

This paper proposes a real-time multiple-workflow scheduling (RMWS) scheme to schedule workflows dynamically with minimum cost under different deadline constraints. Due to the uncertainty of workflow arrival time and specification, RMWS dynamically allocates tasks and divides the scheduling process into three stages. First, when a new workflow arrives, the latest start time and the latest finish time of each task are calculated according to the deadline, and the subdeadline of each task is obtained by probabilistic upward ranking. Then, each ready task is allocated according to its subdeadline and the increased cost of the virtual machine (VM). Meanwhile, only one waiting task can be assigned to each VM to reduce delay fluctuations. Finally, when the task is completed on the assigned VM, all the parameters of the relevant tasks are updated before allocating them to appropriate VMs. The experimental results based on four real-world workflow traces show that the proposed algorithm is superior to two state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of total rental cost, resource utilization, success rate and deadline deviation under different conditions.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3125395","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1006003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606191","Cloud computing;multiple workflows;online scheduling;VM optimization","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Costs;Real-time systems;Dynamic scheduling;Schedules","","74","","46","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The development of smart logistics, powered by precise positioning and communication technologies can significantly improve the efficiency of logistics. The emerging technology of ultra-wideband (UWB) precision positioning has attracted significant attention throughout the previous decade owing to its promising capabilities over other radio frequency-based indoor localisation systems. In addition, UWB is characterised by large bandwidth and data rate, short message length, low transmission power and high penetration capability, which are all favourable for indoor positioning applications. However, UWB localisation technology faces several challenges that are somewhat similar to other technologies, such as mitigating errors that originate from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations and tackling signal interference in dense environments, and when required to operate in extreme conditions. This paper reviews the most recent advances made in UWB positioning systems over the last five years, with a focus on high-ranking articles. In addition to going through more conventional solutions to UWB challenges, modern solutions, which involve the use of machine learning and sensor data fusion, are discussed. We highlight the most promising findings of the recently implemented and foreseen UWB positioning systems by providing a summary of each reviewed article. Additionally, we address a major challenge that faces the UWB positioning technology: NLOS situations, focusing on some proposed remedies such as multi-sensor fusion and machine learning. As an application, this study introduces how UWB technology promotes smart logistics by offering indoor positioning to improve efficiencies in the delivery of goods from the source to the customer. Furthermore, it demonstrates the benefits of UWB technology for accurate positioning and tracking of both stationary and moving items, and machinery in an indoor logistics environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3169267","TULEVA Project; European Regional Fund, European Union; University of Vaasa, Finland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761257","Ultra-wideband (UWB);indoor positioning systems (IPS);smart logistics;navigation and localisation;machine learning;sensor fusion","Logistics;Ultra wideband technology;IP networks;Machine learning;Real-time systems;Optimization;Navigation;Sensor fusion;Indoor navigation","","59","","236","CCBY","21 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Low-latency transmissions are necessary in enabling time-sensitive control systems with high sampling rates to operate over wireless links. Enabling low-latency through fast data rates comes at the cost of reliability in the form of higher packet error rates due to channel noise. However, the impact of such communication link errors on the control system performance depends dynamically on the control system state. We propose a novel control-aware communication design to the low-latency resource allocation problem. In our proposed method, we incorporate both control and channel state information in scheduling transmissions across time slots, frequency bands, and data rates using the next-generation Wi-Fi scheduling architecture. Control systems that are closer to instability or further from a desired range in a given control cycle are given higher packet delivery rate targets to meet. Rather than a simple priority ranking, we derive precise adaptive packet error rate targets for each system needed to satisfy control-specific performance requirements. We use these adaptive rate targets to make scheduling decisions that reduce total transmission time.

The quality of clinical diagnosis relies mainly on the medical knowledge and experience held by doctors. However, the ability of a single doctor is very limited, so the quality of clinical diagnosis is currently not high. In this paper, an aided diagnosis method based on domain semantic knowledge bases is proposed. Firstly, a domain semantic knowledge base is established by extracting and refining the knowledge of the medicine subject matter domain from the Freebase RDF dumps. Then, based on the semantic knowledge base, the algorithms for calculating the weights of the symptoms in the knowledge base, the relative weights of the diseases related to the input symptom set from a patient, and the related symptom set related to the input symptom set from the patient are proposed. Finally, the clinical medical record data of several common diseases are selected to make an evaluation on the proposed method. For each medical record, the symptom information is extracted from the chief complaint as the patient’s input symptom set. Based on the input symptom set, the method of this paper is used to obtain the list of related diseases and the ranking of disease relative weights. From the disease relevance rankings, the Top 1 (first diagnosis) and Top-3 (first 3 diagnoses) are compared with the doctor’s diagnoses in the medical records. Among them, ovarian cyst has the highest Top-1 and Top-3 hit rates of 67.3% and 89.1%, respectively. Followed by acute upper respiratory tract infection, Top-1 and Top-3 hit rates are 56.6% and 85.2%, respectively. The average Top-1 and Top-3 hit rates are 47.9% and 79.7%, respectively. Compared with the relevant methods, the method of this paper is better. The evaluation results show that based on the domain semantic knowledge base and the aided diagnosis method of diseases constructed in this paper, it is possible to provide aided diagnosis services of a large number of common diseases for general practitioners (especially inexperienced doctors) at the grass-roots level as well as self-diagnosis services of diseases for patients.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807365","Ontology;domain semantic knowledge bases;aided diagnosis of diseases;symptom weights;disease relative weights;related symptoms","Diseases;Knowledge based systems;Semantics;Medical diagnostic imaging;Ontologies;Cognition","","33","","","CCBY","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, there are insufficient research studies related to I4.0 development assessment based on the various requirement factors to enable countries to measure their own conditions and to make future national strategies and roadmaps for their activities in this field. Thus, this paper develops a comprehensive framework to assess the countries' readiness level in I4.0 development. The research is conducted in several steps. First, the main required clusters and their criteria of I4.0 development assessment such as technological, social, economic, political and environmental clusters are determined. Second, the importance of the clusters and their criteria are specified using the Fuzzy DEMATLE and Fuzzy ANP techniques. Third, the countries are ranked using the VIKOR technique. In this study, the conditions of I4.0 development for South Korea, the United States, China, Iran, Japan, and Germany are assessed based on the proposed framework. The ranking results show the United States, Germany, and Japan got ranked first to third, based on the obtained VIKOR index, 0.000, 0.528, and 0.559, respectively. The framework is verified using sensitivity analysis and validated based on the countries' existing plans. The evaluation results are rescannable. The result shows that the United States, Germany, Japan, and South Korea got high scores especially in the technological cluster and also some challenges in the criteria related to the social and cultural clusters. On the other hand, China and Iran got the highest score in the labor force criterion of the social cluster (0.023) and the intercultural understanding criterion of the cultural cluster (0.006), respectively, however, they need to strengthen the technological cluster “to be hopeful of having” an active role in future global marketing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957153","Industry 4.0;multi criteria assessment framework;fuzzy;DEMATEL;ANP;VIKOR","Industries;Manufacturing;Production;Economics;Companies;Automation;Decision making","","19","","50","CCBY","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve these objectives, we develop several new holistic genetic algorithms. The proposed model is solved via several methods including weighted sum method and multiobjective genetic algorithms based on dominance rank (GA-1), weighted sum aggregation (GA-2), dominance ranking procedure and crowding distance comparison (GA-3), and heuristic approach (GA-H). This paper illustrates that operations management, which is typically observed as a significant technique that allows manufacturing to operate in challenging data enabled environment in an industrial internet of things ecosystem, can also carefully optimize a production process to improve energy cost in order to manage environmental challenges. Thus, the findings provide information on when to start each job. We provide detailed experimental results evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Nevertheless, the increasingly heavy storage consumption brought by the full-replication data storage mechanism, becomes a bottleneck to the system scalability. To address this problem, a reliable storage scheme named BFT-Store (Qi et al. 2020), integrating erasure coding with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), was proposed recently. While, three critical problems are still left open: (i) The complex re-initialization process of the blockchain when the number of nodes varies; (ii) The high computational overload of downloading data; (iii) The massive communication on the network. This paper proposes a better trade-off for blockchain storage scheme termed PartitionChain which addresses the above three problems, maintaining the merits of BFT-Store. First, our scheme allows the original nodes to merely update a single aggregate signature (e.g., 320 bits) when the number of nodes varies. Using aggregate signatures as the proof of the encoded data not only saves the storage costs but also gets rid of the trusted third party. Second, the computational complexity of retrieving data by decoding, compared to BFT-Store, is greatly reduced by about $2^{18}$218 times on each node. Third, the amount of transmitted data for recovering each block is reduced from $O(n)$O(n) (assuming $n$n is the number of nodes) to $O(1)$O(1), by partitioning each block into smaller pieces and applying Reed-Solomon coding to each block. Furthermore, this paper also introduces a reputation ranking system where the malicious behaviors of the nodes can be detected and marked, enabling PartitionChain to check the credits of each node termly and expel the nodes with misbehavior to the specific extent. Comparing with BFT-Store, our scheme allows blockchain system to suit dynamic network with higher efficiency and scalability.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3136556","NSFC-ISF(grant numbers:61961146004); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:2021-01-07-00-08-E00101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656652","Blockchain storage;reed-solomon coding;Byzantine fault tolerance;system scalability;dynamic network","Blockchains;Encoding;Peer-to-peer computing;Decoding;Computational complexity;Aggregates;Scalability","","14","","45","CCBY","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, traditional recommendation methods easily suffer from the high dimensional problem and cold-start problem. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a PBUED (PLSA-Based Uniform Euclidean Distance) scheme, which utilizes topic model and uniform Euclidean distance to recommend the suitable items for users. The solution first employs probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) to extract users' interests, users with different interests are divided into different subgroups. Then, the uniform Euclidean distance is adopted to compute the users' similarity in the same interest subset; finally, the missing rating values of data are predicted via aggregating similar neighbors' ratings. We evaluate PBUED on two datasets and experimental results show PBUED can lead to better predicting performance and ranking performance than other approaches.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2017.8233650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233650","recommendation system;topic model;user interest;uniform euclidean distance","Euclidean distance;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Probabilistic logic;Matrix decomposition;Feature extraction;Maximum likelihood estimation","","11","","","","22 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Based on the approximate Markov blanket decision, this article puts forward the basis of feature set redundancy elimination. This is used to determine the priority of feature selection by taking the number of features preselection as a measure. The mutual information method is combined with the CRITIC weight to implement redundancy elimination for the initial feature set of the load, and the feature correlation ranking algorithm is established based on the Relief-F method.

The article finds ten CFFs: lack of I4.0 strategy, absence of well-designed smart product/service systems, lack of digital supply chains, leadership is not supportive for I4.0, poor human resource management for I4.0, absence of I4.0 technology transformation management plan, I4.0 is not implemented totally, lack of top management support for I4.0, poor change management strategies in place, and inadequate consideration of sustainability in I4.0 initiative. In the second quantitative phase, 156 senior managers participated in an online survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis, and ranking of CFFs were carried out. The findings on CFFs will help the practitioners and organizations to identify, monitor, and control these factors while implementing I4.0.

This article provides an affirmative answer to this question. Existing fingerprinting schemes work in a kind of stand-alone mode, as they localize a user merely based on her own observations about surrounding environments. However, we argue the existence of scenarios where multiple users request for localization services simultaneously. If they are not far apart, their observations are actually distributed versions of the same environment, which can be exploited to calibrate underlying localization systems. In this article, we propose an online collaborative localization (OCLoc) scheme to boost received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting in scenarios with multiple requesting users. The basic idea of OCLoc is based on the fact of distance attenuated radio propagations. For two users, their received signals from the same access point (AP) can be used to infer who is closer to this AP. We exploit such information for online collaboration and propose a series of operations to calibrate reference points (RPs) from distributed versions of radio attenuation observations. By integrating user calibration and fingerprint distance, we define a new ranking measure for reselecting and weighting candidate RPs to output the final location. Experiments on field measurements validate the effectiveness of such online collaborations in terms of greatly reduced localization errors.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3019254","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771209); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177082","Indoor localization;online collaborative localization (OCLoc);received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting","Collaboration;Internet of Things;Wireless fidelity;Hardware;Distance measurement;Smart phones;Dead reckoning","","7","","41","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When embedding binary code into matrix by neural network, the problem of feature representation also needs to be solved in vulnerability detection. However, most of the current researches extract the syntax or structural features of binary code, and take basic block as the minimum analysis unit, which is relatively coarse. In addition, the structural features of binary functions are usually represented by the dependency graph. In the embedding process, only the neighbour information of the node can be obtained, ignoring the global information of the graph. To solve these two problems, we propose a two-channel feature extraction method to obtain semantic feature in finer granularity and represent the structural features globally instead of locally. Inspired by natural language process, we propose a contextual semantic feature extraction method to obtain different granularity features of binary functions. It takes instruction as the minimum analysis unit and obtains the semantic relationship between instructions. Meanwhile, in order to represent the structural feature of each function, we propose a neural GAE model instead of the widely used structure2vec model. In this way, we can preserve and reconstruct the control dependencies between the basic blocks in the whole graph. We have implemented a prototype system BEDetector, evaluated the effectiveness of its neural model and compared the accuracy of vulnerability function detection with state-of-the-art system. Besides, we choose the real-world firmware files as the detection target and prove that BEDetector can achieve a relatively high detection rate.

Combining with open-source network information, these trajectories reveal the semantics of users’ social behaviors in their travels, thus indicating their behavioral traces. Based on such social mobilities, attackers can explore users’ potential behavioral patterns and launch powerful behavioral-semantic inferential attacks for behavior prediction, identity identification, and threatening users’ location-related mobile privacy. Even through privacy protection, the released similar anonymous semantics may still bring significant privacy gains to such attacks. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no effective technique to counter such attacks and protect user behavioral semantics in mobile Internet services. To this end, this article proposes a posterior behavioral-semantic privacy-preserving solution, BSPri, by simulating the inferential attacks to eliminate the privacy risks associated with released traces. Specifically, we represent the logical association between semantic attributes and propose a similar semantic clustering and ranking method. Then, we formalize the user social-mobility stochastic process to characterize the privacy risks arising from the attacker’s observation of the released trajectory, and define a observation-based posterior privacy authentication criteria to filter anonymous semantics further. Finally, we generate synthetic trajectories with similar anonymity semantics, which bring attackers insignificant privacy gain, for users to participate in applications.

In this paper, we propose an emerging online collaborative localization paradigm to serve the scenarios of multiple users requesting localizations at the same time, which enables a kind of collective calibration by exploiting latent relations in between requesting users in both the signal space and physical space. The proposed scheme is called MOCLoc, which first applies the multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique to compute online users’ virtual locations based on their online fingerprints. A new virtual location credibility is next computed for each selected reference point (RP) based on the similarity between its virtual distances and physical distances to other online users. We also compute a collaborative credibility and signal credibility and fuse all three kinds of credibilities to compute a new RP ranking weight that is used to output the user final location. Furthermore, we propose to include a device calibration module based on the mean-subtraction fingerprint transformation to differentiate the collaborative calibration process for heterogeneous online devices.

To improve the efficiency of computations, approximate computing is widely used in today’s arithmetic circuits. For simple arithmetic units, manual approximation methods achieved high efficiency. However, with the increasing scale and complexity of the calculation circuit, the approximation efficiency of manual approximation method is gradually reduced and the difficulty of judging the approximate part is also increasing. To this end, automatic approximation methods become especially important. For automatic approximation methods, the key challenge is choosing a metric to guide the approximation process which is easy to calculate accurately and minimize the time spent on it. Therefore, modified optimal slope ranking (OSR) method is proposed in this paper for improving the metric precision and greatly reducing the time cost of approximation process. The simulation results show that the proposed method shows advantages in different circuits, including adders, fixed-width multipliers and DCT. Compared with manual approximation methods, modified OSR method achieves 16.8% lower EDP consumption than competitors on fixed-width multipliers. Compared with our previous work, the proposed method achieves an EDP advantage of 9.17% on DCT at highest accuracy mode. At the lowest accuracy, modified OSR method still maintains certain performance advantages and becomes more obvious as the circuit complexity increases for all precision modes. In terms of time consumption, modified OSR method achieves a speed increase of nearly 10% with the highest precision and a speed increase of up to  $7.73\times $  for DCT at the lowest accuracy. In addition, modified OSR also provides flexible precision choices for different application scenarios.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2020.2984526","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61874023,61534002); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2018J030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9067061","Approximate computing;approximation efficiency;automatic approximation;circuit pruning","Approximation methods;Estimation;Approximate computing;Adders;Delays;Manuals","","2","","24","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This trend is also driving innovation and progress in various fields, including healthcare, transportation, and industry. However, as technology continues to proliferate, network security concerns have become increasingly prominent, making the protection of digital life and data security an urgent priority. Intrusion detection has always played an important role in the field of network security. Traditional intrusion detection systems predominantly rely on anomaly detection technology to identify potential intrusions by detecting abnormal patterns in network traffic. With technological advancements, machine learning-based methods have emerged as the cornerstone of modern intrusion detection, enabling more precise identification of abnormal behaviors and potential intrusions by learning the patterns of normal network traffic. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection model that amalgamates the Attention-CNN-BiLSTM (ACBL) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) architectures. The ACBL and TCN models excel in processing spatial and temporal features within network traffic data, respectively. This integration harnesses diverse neural network structures to elevate overall model performance and accuracy. Furthermore, a unique approach inspired by dung beetles’ natural behavior, incorporating Tent mapping-enhanced Dung Beetle Optimization Algorithm (TDBO), is leveraged for both optimizing feature selection parameters and searching for optimal model hyperparameters. The feature selection parameters obtained from TDBO are then combined with the importance ranking from the Random Forest algorithm, ensuring optimal features can be better selected to enhance model performance. This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection model, the TDBO-ACBLT model, and validates its performance using the UNSW-NW15 dataset. TDBO excels in feature selection compared to common algorithms and achieves superior parameter optimization accuracy over Harris’s Hawk Optimization (HHO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO). The proposed model achieves higher accuracy than prevalent machine learning models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3353488","Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan Project(grant numbers:22511100700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398201","Intrusion detection;network security;machine learning;deep learning;model fusion;dung beetle optimization algorithm DBO","Feature extraction;Optimization;Network intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Random forests","","1","","24","CCBYNCND","12 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we propose a Truthful Dynamic Reverse Auction (TDRA) mechanism to motivate vehicles to participate in service provisioning. To realize TDRA, we first propose an enumeration-based allocation strategy to optimally allocate subtasks among vehicles and obtain a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based pricing strategy that can ensure the economic properties of individual rationality and truthfulness. Then, to deal with the high computational complexity of obtaining the optimal solution, we develop a near-optimal Dynamic Bilateral Ranking (DBR) allocation strategy to allocate subtasks within polynomial time and design a critical value-based pricing strategy that can also guarantee the two above-mentioned economic properties.

The significance of data has prompted relevant research communities and application developers how to harness the values of these data in secure manufacturing. Critical data analysis, identification of critical factors to improve the manufacturing process and critical data associated with product quality have been investigated in the current literature. However, the current works on product quality control are mainly based on static data analysis, where data may change, but there is no way to adjust them dynamically. Thus, they are not applicable for product quality control, at which point their adjustment is instantly required. However, many manufacturing systems exist, like beverages and food, where ingredients must be adjusted instantaneously to maintain product quality. To address this research gap, we introduce a method that identifies the critical data based on their ranking by exploiting three criticality assessment criteria that capture the instantaneous product quality change during manufacturing. These three criteria are – (1) correlation, (2) percentage quality change and (3) sensitivity for the assessment of data criticality. The product quality is estimated using polynomial regression (POLY), SVM, and DNN. The proposed method is validated using wine manufacturing data. Our proposed method accurately identifies critical data, where SVM produces the lowest average production quality prediction error (10.40%) compared with that of POLY (11%) and DNN (14.40%).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3276942","Defence Science Institute (DSI), Australia, through the DSI-Facilitated Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128109","IIoT-enabled manufacturing;data criticality;criteria;product quality control;wine-quality","Quality assessment;Product design;Industrial Internet of Things;Data models;Monitoring;Manufacturing processes;Vehicle dynamics;Quality control","","","","81","CCBYNCND","17 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The pivotal role of social media in facilitating information seeking and sharing during crises underscores the need to identify factors that enhance resilience in crisis communication. As a result, the study presented herein delves into the intricate interplay between information-seeking, information-sharing, and social media usage factors, examining their influence on resilience within the context of crisis management. Utilizing the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the research creates a comprehensive hierarchical model of these factors and elucidates their priorities through expert pair-wise comparisons. The results reveal that information-seeking factors dominate the ranking, highlighting the paramount importance of understanding how individuals seek and engage with information during crises. Specifically, the findings suggest that factors such as media choice, crisis type, and trust play pivotal roles in resilience building during crisis situations. In the realm of information sharing, the study underscores the significance of factors like sentiment, authority, and relevance in shaping the resonance and effectiveness of shared content. Moreover, the analysis unveils the outcomes of social media usage factors, spotlighting elements such as media exposure, uncertainty, and involvement, and showcasing their role in driving individuals’ engagement with crisis-related content on social platforms. By leveraging the AHP methodology, this research unravels the priorities of factors that underpin the efficacy of Social Media Crisis Communication (SMCC). Accordingly, it underscores the potential of AHP as an invaluable tool for navigating the intricate landscape of SMCC literature, offering fresh perspectives and empirical insights. Embracing the prioritized factors unveiled in this analysis, crisis managers and communicators can tailor their strategies to better align with the dynamics of social media and enhance resilience-building efforts in an ever-evolving crisis landscape.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3383317","Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) under University Research Fund and Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10485423","Social media;crisis communication;AHP;resilience;information seeking;information sharing","Social networking (online);Resilience;Crisis management;Media;Surveys;Information sharing;Web sites;Analytical models","","","","56","CCBYNCND","29 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A promising approach to this challenge involves leveraging Human Action Recognition (HAR) by integrating data from multiple sensors. However, the field of HAR has struggled to strike a balance between accuracy and response time. While technological advancements have improved recognition accuracy, complex algorithms often come at the expense of response time. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative asynchronous detection method called Rapid Response Elderly Safety Monitoring (RESAM), which relies on progressive hierarchical action recognition and multi-sensor data fusion. Through initial analysis of inertial sensor data using Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and multi-class classifiers, we efficiently reduce processing time and lower the false-negative rate (FNR). The inertial sensor identification serves as a pre-filter, enabling the identification of filtered abnormal signals. Decision-level data fusion is then executed, incorporating skeleton image analysis based on ResNet and the inertial sensor data from the initial step. This integration enables the accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal behaviors. The RESAM method achieves an impressive 97.4% accuracy on the UTD-MHAD database with a minimal delay of 1.22 seconds. On our internally collected database, the RESAM system attains an accuracy of 99%, ranking among the most accurate state-of-the-art methods available.

However, most of the existing V-FiWi integration systems mainly focused on the virtual network request (VNR) acceptance ratio, InP revenue, and substrate resource utilization, and they ignored the crucial issue called higher energy consumption cost, which was resulted from the imbalanced consumption of the substrate resource between the arrival and departure of VNR. In this article, we devote to exploring the energy-aware virtual network migration (EA-VNM) problem over the FiWi access technology, aiming to reoptimize the energy consumption while maintaining the high InP revenue and the large substrate resource utilization. In response to this issue, we first represent the service-oriented V-FiWi broadband access network architecture from the perspective of computing, storage, and network resource constraints, in which a migration model consisting of migration node and migration time is explained in detail. Then, we propose an enhanced KM-based energy-aware node migration (EKM-ENM) algorithm to economize on more bandwidth resource. More specially, the EA-VNM technology consists of network topology attributes and global network resources-based node-ranking measurement (NRM) phase, maximum weight matching-based node migration phase, and energy-aware link migration phase via Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. Finally, a rather large number of simulations are analyzed and evaluated numerically. Simulation results suggest that the proposed EKM-ENM algorithm outperforms the traditional embedding algorithms in terms of saving energy cost, decreasing time complexity, and improving VNR acceptance ratio.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3189081","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871062); Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN201800615,KJQN201900609); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China(grant numbers:cstc2020jcyjzdxmX0024,cstc2021jcyj-msxm2025); Key Project of Science and Technology of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJZD-K201901203); University Innovation Research Group of Chongqing(grant numbers:CXQT20017,CXQT20024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817090","Energy conservation;fiber wireless broadband access network (FiWi);greedy path selection;maximum weight matching;migration time;virtual network migration (VNM)","Resource management;5G mobile communication;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Substrates;Internet of Things;Optical fiber networks","","","","36","CCBY","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This task aims to localize a target moment semantically corresponding to a given language query in an untrimmed video. Many existing VLG methods rely on the proposal-based framework, despite the dominant performance achieved, they usually focus on interacting a few internal frames with the query to score segment proposals, trapping in the long-range dependencies when the proposal feature is limited. Meanwhile, adjacent proposals share similar visual semantics, making VLG models hard to align the accurate semantics of video-query contents and degenerating the ranking performance. To remedy the above limitations, we propose VLG-CRF by introducing the conditional random fields (CRFs) to handle the discrete yet indistinguishable proposals. Specifically, VLG-CRF consists of two cascade CRF-based modules. The AttentiveCRFs is developed for multi-modal feature fusion to better integrate temporal and semantic relation between modalities. We also devise a new variant of ConvCRFs to capture the relation of discrete segments and rectify the predicting scores to make relatively high prediction scores clustered in a range. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Caption, and TACoS, show the superiority of our method and the state-of-the-art performance is achieved.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3303712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214636","Vision-language grounding;Conditional random fields;Temporal relation;Proposal free","Proposals;Task analysis;Grounding;Semantics;Conditional random fields;Location awareness;Indexes","","","","","IEEE","11 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It often has poor retrieval performance under modality gap. One way to alleviate such the modality discrepancy is to learn shared person features that are generalizable across different modalities. However, because of significant differences in color between the visible and infrared images, the learned share features are always inclined to specific information of corresponding modality. To this end, we propose a modality bias calibration network (MBCNet) that filters out identity-irrelevant interference and recalibrates the learned modality-shared features. Specifically, to emphasize the modality-shared cues, we employ a feature decomposition module in the feature-level to filter out style variations and extract identity-relevant discriminative cues from the residual feature. In order to achieve a better disentanglement, a dual ranking entropy constraint is further proposed to ensure that the learned features contain only identity-relevant information and discard style-relevant information. Simultaneously, we design a decorrelated orthogonality Loss to ensure the disentangled features are not correlated with each other. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate thatMBCNet significantly improves the cross-modality retrieval performance in social surveillance systems and effectively addresses the modality bias training issue.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2024.3398696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10566608","Cross-modality learning;feature disentanglement;modality bias;visible–infrared person reidentification (VI-ReID)","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Training;Cameras;Calibration;Decorrelation;Visualization","","","","","IEEE","20 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The present work proposes an integrated approach for extensive study with a set of criteria and possible Industry 5.0 enablers in consumer electronics using a novel decision-making approach. The approach comprises of  $T$ -spherical fuzzy information containment/processing through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and then utilizing the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) sequentially to obtain the necessary weights of selected criteria. Further, the obtained weights from AHP would be used in WASPAS for the computational assessment while finding the prioritization/ranking of industry 5.0 enablers.

The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools such as deep neural networks to overcome the data sparsity issue with typical collaborative filtering models. Existing works on AI driven recommender systems are focusing on improving recommendation accuracy by extracting rich user/item features from multi-source data with deep learning tools to build more accurate user preference model. How to ensure the responsibility of AI driven recommender systems is still a big challenge. On one hand, AI driven recommender systems need to access raw data such as user profiles to train recommendation model, which face the risk of leaking user privacy information. On the other hand, the ever increasing volume of user/item interaction records raise the efficiency challenge to provide recommendation results in a real time manner. In view of those observations, we propose a collaborative recommendation method by adopting the Locality-Sensitive-Hashing technique (i.e., DisRecLSH), which aims to achieve the goal of privacy protection and calculation efficiency for AI driven recommender systems. More specifically, we split DisRecLSH into three phases: (1) Offline feature extraction: deep neural networks are applied to extract user/item features from multi-source user/item data on each local data set. (2) Offline user index building: Locality Sensitive Hashing technique is adopted to map user features to hash codes to quickly recall correlated similar users for a given target user. (3) Online Top-N items calculation: with similar users selected by phase 2, Top-N items are calculated based on the ranking of predicted user-item rating score. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to evaluate the efficiency of our proposal.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2024.3381571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10479080","collaborative filtering;locality-sensitive-hashing;AI-driven recommender systems;privacy protection","Artificial intelligence;Feature extraction;Recommender systems;Data models;Collaboration;Privacy;Artificial neural networks","","","","","IEEE","25 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It is crucial to select an appropriate charging station based on user preferences; however, current selection solutions are limited and primarily focus on proximity or price. Such an approach neglects other significant factors of interest to EV users, namely charging time, waiting time, charging cost, and available facilities near the EVCS. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel recommendation scheme, the User-Preferences based Charging Station Recommendation Scheme (UPCSRS), which integrates user preferences with Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) theory to suggest the best available charging stations for EV users. UPCSRS consists of two parts: adopting Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) for weighting the importance of each selection criterion and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking available charging stations. A mathematical model of the proposed scheme was developed, and then the effectiveness and accuracy were evaluated using MATLAB and a real dataset from the US Department of Energy website. Results showed that this proposed scheme provides more precise and personalized recommendations for users compared to current solutions that only consider the nearest or cheapest option. By enhancing the overall user experience through a more customized and efficient charging station selection process, this proposed scheme has the potential to contribute to more EVs adoption.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2024.3379469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494708","Multi-attribute decision-making;recommendation scheme;electric vehicles","Charging stations;Vehicles;Costs;Petroleum;Automobiles;Vehicle dynamics;Real-time systems","","","","","IEEE","8 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

First, TSC expanded its scope by introducing the new taxonomy of services computing (http://www.computer.org/ portal/web/tsc/taxonomy). This new taxonomy broadens the scope of TSC from the foundations of services computing to cover cloud computing services, big data technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), social computing, and business management. This new taxonomy refl ects the continued advancements of services computing from both services science and services engineering perspectives. Second, TSC has expanded its editorial board to 43 associate editors in response to the broadening scope of TSC and the growing community of researchers and practitioners as authors and readers. More importantly, the TSC community continues to expand and attract both technical professionals and business management professionals. In recognition of its important role, TSC has been indexed by major indexing systems, such as Thomson Reuters (ISI), EI Compendex, and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-e). TSC welcomes 2014 with a number of new projects on the way. We are introducing survey papers as a featured section in TSC regular issues, in addition to special topic sections where guest editors are invited to solicit submissions on hot and emerging topics of special interests. We are planning to work with the steering committees of the IEEE International Conference on Web Services and the IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing to create TSC special sessions. Authors of TSC accepted papers are offered an opt-in opportunity to present their work at one of these two conferences. The EiC is working closely with the TSC advisory board to explore new dimensions to attract higher readership and authorship from the business and management community. Finally, The EiC will continue to work with the TSC editorial board through multiple threads to maintain the average review cycle of three months and the average queuing time of less than one year for accepted papers to appear. One new thread of such effort is to continue TSC's participation in the newly introduced Reviewer Appreciation Program by the IEEE Computer Society.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2014.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6731393","","","","7","","","IEEE","4 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
